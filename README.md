# CovidET-EMNLP22
This repo contains the dataset for the EMNLP 2022 paper: "Why Do You Feel This Way? Summarizing Triggers of Emotions in Social Media Posts".

For privacy concerns, we only release the annotations and the corresponding IDs in Reddit (and *not*} original posts). We recommend using the the <a href="https://psaw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PSAW wrapper for Pushshift API</a> to gather the original Reddit posts from the Reddit IDs in the dataset. Besides, we also anonymize the names of people as well as businesses mentioned in our dataset.
