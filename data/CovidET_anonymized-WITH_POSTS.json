I lost my uncle who is my best friend, we lived abroad all our lives but because of the pandemic I returned home, and barely managed to see him those 2 years. He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return. But he barely lasted a week before his death. But mentally I am exhausted of living here, of the pandemic, of having my friends all abroad and getting out of contact, of being alone to face his death. To face this life. Life feels so tasteless.",

Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.",

Every health professional that Ive seen regarding it hasnt seemed to think its that much of a big deal as Im medicated and blood work looks fine, but I will be on meds for it for the rest of my life. I dont trust what these health professionals are telling me because they all seem to have different opinions and some have willingly admitted that they dont know enough about autoimmune diseases. Ive been told that Im not at any greater risk of getting covid because of my disease, but have read differently. Im concerned about getting the vaccine because Ive heard from another doctor that its linked to autoimmune responses, but I cant find much online about the matter and Im afraid that if I dont get the vaccine, Ill be putting myself at greater risk. However, Im also afraid that the vaccine will cause further autoimmune problems, as the disease I already have is already a lot to deal with especially when I cant find a health professional that knows enough about it to help me. Im hoping someone here might be able to drop some knowledge?",

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.",

After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time. Does what I describe track with anyone's experience? I wonder for how long I'll be unable to exercise without precipitating unwanted flare-ups of Covid symptoms or Covid vaccine side effects.",

That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before.

        "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.",

I decided not to get the second shot with my doctor's support, because I've been so unwell that they say my body needs a break. I was hospitalized for a rapid heartbeat and chest pain 2 weeks ago which I was told is pleurisy. The pain has only gotten worse, but the doctor told me that it will eventually go away. I can't drive anymore because I don't have the strength in my arms to navigate the steering wheel. I can't even pick up a water glass with one hand. I sleep 3 or 4 hours a nite because the pain keeps waking me up. I made the tough decision today to withdraw from school this term because I just feel so delirious a lot of the time now that my brain can't do it. These physical and mental effects are just making me feel pretty bummed out and sad. I know that I'm lucky to not have it as bad as many other people during these Covid times. But I feel really alone in this, as everyone around me is getting vaccinated and going out and enjoying life, right as I'm getting so sick and homebound. I have faith that this will get better, I'm just having a hard time accepting that I need to put my life on hold until it does. Support, kind words, anything, much appreciated. And to add again - please get vaccinated! My experience is very rare and everyone I know had minimal side effects, if any. That's part of what's making me feel so alone in this!",

        "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with <ORG>. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.",

Im more nervous about the restrictions that come with these surges and that if a big surge happens colleges will switch to online learning which i really dont want to happen since I miss my friends in my college state. I was feeling so much better mentally weeks ago and felt super optimistic because of low numbers and I feel like this delta variant has just put a wrench in that. I know that since Im fully vaccinated I dont need to worry a whole lot about it but I just dont want to see a repeat of 100,000 cases a day and different restrictions. I just want these variants to stop because it seems like everytime Im semi happy a new one makes a surprise and turns out to be more contagious. Anyways thanks for reading this rant",

I was recently mentioning this to a friend who told me that this was overkill since apparently new research has shown it is not needed. Is this true? The friend also sides with the CDC over WHO regarding mask usage for vaccinated people so I'm apprehensive to listen to them. If there is research along these lines then I it saying it is not possible to spread through groceries/deliveries or that it is simply a lower chance. If it matters, I'm fully vaccinated with <ORG>.

Very few countries are exempt from this, almost entirely small islands around the world. Meanwhile Denmark's infection numbers have doubled, yay European football events. So the hopes of ever getting on the UK's green list are smaller and smaller. I have since the start of this whole thing been worrying about loved ones. First my elderly grandparents for being high risk, then my best friend who had her baby very premature, then my mum was bedridden for months due to covid, and now my dad has cancer and has to have chemo. It has been almost a full year since I saw a single family member, more than a year for many of them. And not even a glimmer of hope. I am fully vaccinated even, and I am watching people here happy about losing restrictions, but I am so scared of losing someone after being away for so long and it's getting more and more overwhelming. I know nobody can say magic words to fix things, I just really needed to vent about how it's July 2021 and this is still ongoing for the foreseeable future.",

My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that. TLDR; Any tips as to how to get out of my head and regain that sense of safety to be alone again after suffering anxiety because of the pandemic?",

While Im out, Ive surprisingly found Im quite bored when I leave my house, but the real problem comes the day afterwards. I sit and think was that too soon? Can I re-enter my bubble now that people have seen me? Am I a hypocrite? And these questions flow through my brain in a never ending sequence. Feeling that Ive been perceived by others and I cant take it back feels unbearable, yet I took the decision to leave my house so I then encounter feelings of embarrassment, guilt and shame. Not to mention the obvious fear of the delta variant, and overall uncertainty over cdc recommendations. (I wish someone could spell out a good plan for reintegration besides - rip off the mask and live!) Everyone I know has returned to life normally and Im here in a weird limbo. I know a lot of people in this struggle with just leaving the house, but is anyone else out there struggling with how they feel once they do?",

That we dont know the long term effects. But I got it anyway. And now Im starting to think about it more. Ive always been a hypochondriac. And lately, Ive been aware of my heartbeat. When Im resting, I can feel it in my chest by itself. I remember reading an article about teens having heart problems or palpitations after getting the vaccine. And now Im worried that Im one of those people. But I also dont know if it could be other things. Maybe its because Im inactive. Or how I eat. I dont know. Im getting my 2nd vaccine shot on Friday. But if my heart thing is vaccine related, wont it get worse? Im scared. You cant unvaccinate yourself. If I get my second and it gives me heart problems the rest of my life, Im screwed. I survived covid once. What if I made a mistake? I dont know anymore. Im scared of both things. I hate being a hypochondriac.",

If it is, then please suggest a better place to post it (in this thread, or in a PM, or via whatever form of communication suits you. Regarding the mask. I say \"covid filtration efficiency\" because I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for. I assume I should be looking at \"viral filtration efficiency\" scores/tests but for what particle size? I seem to recall hearing that your typical covid aerosol is about 0.3 micrometers in diameter but I could definitely be wrong about that. I'm guessing I can simply close off a valve with some kind of solid object, but I'm not sure. Certainly, I want to avoid risking spreading the virus to others in the case that I become infected (I suppose one might argue that with properly wearing a very protective mask I am unlikely to be infected in the first place. Don't ask me about the legitimacy of that argument though) The goal here is to get a mask with a high degree of protection against covid. My mother is aged and smokes a lot and my country is in the middle of a covid delta variant spike so I need a high degree of protection. Whether I'm severely paranoid or otherwise, 95% filtration efficiency is not enough to satisfy me. You have my thanks in advance for your assistance, and my apologies for any imposition.",

Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying. My immediate family knows that I suffer with it, but no one aside from my brother really understands the levity of how crippling it can be. I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop spiraling and calming myself down around everyone? Will having these spiraling thoughts about COVID hurting my loved ones and I ever going to end?",

There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(<ORG>). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite. Like I have the caveman syndrome when it comes to larger groups. How do you evaluate the situation? I guess I just need some opinions on it. Thanks for reading so far!:)",

I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose. However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts. Not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but I cant think of anything else If this was due to the vaccine, does that put me at any risk of having a severe allergic reaction with the second dose? Second, I am a woman in my early twenties. Ive heard reports of myocarditis after the second dose in young people. This is quite scary to me as Im very active. Should I be concerned?

I live in Italy and here we had three lockdowns, the last one ending around May. They left me absolutely burnt out. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore. A lot of nice things are happening to me: I am graduating on Monday, I got my vaccine and maybe my boyfriend will finally be able to come visit after 18 months of not seeing each other. But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again. I hadn't been on antidepressants since 2019 and now I lost all my progress. I feel so guilty because my family and friends are all so excited and proud of me but I feel empty, scared and sad all the time. I just wish this never happened.",

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish. Support and advice appreciated - thanks y'all",

They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.",

With that said, Im now seeing more and more reports (including this <ORG> report: [url] saying that the new Delta variant will cause the country as a whole to have to reimplement mask and social distancing requirements, especially in states with lower vaccination rates. Consequently, Im feeling increasingly worried that Ill come back in August only to find its gone back to not being safe to see anyone and classes have gone back to being mostly (if not completely) virtual, especially since my home state is one of those mUh FrEeDoMs states with low vaccination rates (granted, Im sure theyd be hesitant to require masks for the same reason, but a lack of that requirement doesnt change how safe or not safe things are).

I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the <ORG> vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like \"i can't, i need to study/work\", \"I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me?

So why are there no TREATMENTS? Since the pandemic started scientists have been testing vitamin D and freaking hydroxychloroquine over and over and over again. Let's try other strategies. Let's have a new \"operation warp speed\" and develop new drugs. Let's try antifibrotics to prevent lung fibrosis. Because I'm so tired of people saying \"vaccines prevent against hospitalization!\". I don't want to just avoid being hospitalized, I want to avoid permanent lung damage. People with mild or even asymptomatic covid are often left with permanent lung damage, but no one is talking about it. Do you want COPD and fibrosis lungs? I certainly don't. I'm moving to the UK soon and with tbe Delta variant raging I feel like a sitting duck. I'm so scared and hopeless because if I get Covid there's nothing I can do to save my lungs from fibrosing. We have to learn to \"live with covid\", so where are the treatments to make it tolerable?",

I was 34 when COVID started and now Im 35, but I feel SO OLD. Like, covid aged me and I crossed a threshold from young adult to middle aged all of the sudden. I feel like any hope/positivity I had in the past is gone now and replaced by never ending existential dread. I have always been depressive, but it was about stuff that could be changed like my weight - not depression at an existential level. Its bigger than covid - once we get through this, society is gonna be permanently changed and I wouldnt be surprised if this results in either civil war in the US or some sort of world war. And climate change is gonna accelerate and were just going to let it happen and well all die. I dunno - I was aware of political instability and the gravity of climate change before covid... but neither was really a tangible and present threat like it feels like it is now. I guess I miss that sense of general security and ignorance. I miss that I could listen to music, spend time with friends/family, work - without constantly thinking whats the point?",

I have even made plans to finally fly down my boyfriend to come visit me in my apartment at the start of August in a few weeks. Then this delta variant starts becoming the main thing in the news being reported about and i feel my fear setting in again. I still really want to see my boyfriend has he bought the tickets already and we made plans on how to be super safe while at the airport to the best of his ability. Im just still so terrified that somehow he will get a breakthrough infection despite being fully vaccinated (moderna) and masked up and somehow will be able to pass it on to me via breakthrough infection. To my knowledge cases are still pretty low and he lives in MN and coming to my state which is Georgia where we plan to get him as quickly as possible out of the airport come home and sanitize some things. Even with all the precautions we are taking im still worried that something might happen but i don't know if its my overwhelming covid anxiety or what.

This person was not an anti-vax, just ambivalent and lazy. Me expressing my concern helped them over the finish line, and this is the first person I can say that I am personally responsible for getting the vaccine besides myself. One person doesn't sound like a lot but really one person is worth it. I encourage everyone to think about someone in your life right now who is unvaccinated but just might need a steady hand to hold to get them down off the fence, and try for them, if you have the mental energy for it. Something that helped my friend is telling him how effective the vaccines are at keeping vaccinated people out of the hospital. Good luck!",

A friend will fly to visit two days after I got my second shot, and I am wondering how safe it is for me to meet with somebody shortly after getting my last dose? Will the vaccine already protect me at its full potential, or how much will it be? I have read all sorts of articles that say basically something between 30% and 90%??? This person will also get his second shot a few days before but is not as concerned as I am about it. He has contact with people at his job, and is basically going out and traveling again - wearing a mask and distancing ofc. I have been in isolation and wear a mask everywhere I go since the pandemic started. I am mostly concerned by long covid and other diseases that can be triggered by it. Thanks in advance!",

The reason I ask this? As much as I have done my part in wearing masks, I have grown weary of it, and I find them super uncomfortable to breathe in. Only time I would ever consider using them is in cold weather OR if I'm under the weather, but I'm at the point where I feel it is no longer necessary. Which is why I'm holding off on traveling until the mask mandate is gone. When I mentioned this on another subforum, others thought I was crazy and started pushing masks on me. I was offended that they weren't respecting my choice because I firmly feel uncomfortable traveling as long as the virus is around and as long as the mask mandate is on there. That's why I'm hoping that April 2022 will be a better time to travel to Florida than right now.",

Their maid of honour has rented a whole house for 3 days in a place 4 hours away. This would mean staying with approximately 12 other people, most who I dont know, not to mention sharing a bed and room etc. They have also planned lots of activities like paintball, laser tag, cocktail classes and dinners. Im feeling super anxious about the whole thing: 1. Because of Covid. I currently work in ICU, I caught Covid last year and had a real rough time recovering, and Ive barely gone out much except with close family. I am double vaccinated so that at least helps. At present, its actually against our guidelines to have so many people inside from different households, but this is meant to change at the end of July - unless cases continue to rise which they are. 2. Because of guilt if I decline and dont go, I dont want to let my friend down, I think she would probably stop inviting me places/to her wedding. And no one else in the group seems anxious over Covid, theyre all excited about going. I feel like if I say I cant go because of Covid, the group will all try and convince me it will be safe to go. I honestly dont know what to do, I know if I say I will go Im going to have so much anxiety all month leading up to it. I have to reply to the invite in the next few days. If anyone has been in this situation or has advice I would really appreciate it :)",

So far, the Upper East is not, but I do fear that there may be chances of us being blown back to square one and all the progress we've made so far being thrown out the window. I hope that doesn't happen, but based on how I've seen the cases climb lately (although today they WERE at 8k), I wonder if I'm overanalyzing this.

Now that things are the way they are in the US, I've been trying to make an effort to see each of my friends at least once this summer, especially as I'll be moving across the country at the end of August. But these days, I've been finding myself completely wiped out after meeting up with one friend for 2-3 hours. As in... after I get home, I spend the rest of the day slowly building up the energy to even do minor errands around the house (but most of the time I just sink into the couch and stare at the TV for the rest of the day). I've also been purposely scheduling only one hangout every 3-4 days as my energy levels are only really better after that many days. Is this completely out of the ordinary? Pre-pandemic, I used to be able to handle seeing my coworkers every day, socializing and interacting with them throughout the day and at lunch, and would usually schedule dinner or a hangout with a friend every other day no problem. I feel so wrung out and tired after these hangouts, that I'm not even sure I've had fun by the end of them... I've tried to leave early a couple times too, but maybe my hints aren't strong enough, because I find that my friends don't say goodbye until I really emphasize that I have something to do at home. I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired. I want to just say no to 90% of these hangouts but I also feel guilty since I'm leaving and basically set hard limits on in-person hangouts prior to being vaccinated. &amp;#x200B; I don't even know what the purpose of this post is... but I just spent the last 6 hours recovering from a 3 hour hang out. Can anyone else relate?",

I've definitely been put through the ringer in the past year and a half - I lost my job which meant my right to live in the UK hung in the balance for a few months, and obviously didn't see any family or friends back home in the US. As of mid-June, I've been fully vaccinated so I flew back to the US to spend time with family during the month of July. I am really happy to see everyone I love, but I'm also experience immense anxiety. I think the thought of going back to normal, when it ISN'T normal and covid is still a threat, is causing me to spiral. It doesn't feel real to be back home, for one. Sometimes, it feels like I'm dissociating because somewhere that's so familiar feels foreign. I feel anxious and guilty about travelling with the variants circulating, and going out (despite the fact I avoid crowded areas and still wear masks indoors). It's setting off other anxieties as well, like intrusive thoughts of suddenly dying or dying early. There's no real point of this post I guess, I just wanted to say it and see if anyone felt similarly. I just had a breakdown and I'm so tired of feeling this way. All I want is to go back to London and be with my boyfriend to have that shred of safety that I felt throughout the pandemic.",

If he hears that I went to a workout class or got a haircut indoors, he sighs deeply and tells me that Ive disappointed him. He also makes judgmental comments constantly to everyone for doing anything that involves going almost everywhere. This isnt too bad for me, because I moved out and live independently. But its really hard on my mom who lives with him. He gets mad at her for going on walks outside and constantly criticizes her. I worry very much about their mental health. Sometimes I think about standing up to him more, telling him he cant tell me what to do, but I know it probably wouldnt do any good. I know hes functioning out of anxiety. Does anyone have a relative that has become extremely (and unhealthily) judgmental and controlling, and if so, how do you cope with it?",

When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I am so conflicted on what to do because, in a selfish way, I dont want to wear a mask because I just want to go back to normal. On the other hand, I would feel guilty if I got Covid and gave it to my unvaccinated brother. I am still weighing the pros and cons because I am healthy teenager but I know the Delta Variant is the most dangerous strains yet. I care so much about my brother and protecting others that I am scared I might make the wrong decision. What should I do?",

        "Reddit Post": "Im going into my second year of college. For reference, I was a 2020 high school grad so I was one of the thousands who was robbed of an actual graduation, prom, senior activities, etc. Then my first year of college was also kinda sucky. First semester of my freshman year, I stayed home and did courses online because I was nervous about the virus and getting infected. Also wanted to protect people and being younger, I had a fear of spreading it to older people. Second semester of college, I actually moved on campus where I met a lot of friends and had fun. But I always wore my mask, hung out with a few friends who also always protected themselves, and never went to parties despite most of the student body going to these parties every week. School starts next month and things are pretty much back to normal. No masks required. Full stadiums. Sorority events in-person. All of it which Im super excited about. As the first person to go to college in my family, this was the college life I was so excited to live. Especially since college is such a short time experience and Im already 25% through with it. BUT I feel like COVID and the Delta variant (possibly the Lambda as well) will take that away from me again. So I have a fear of school shutting down later this fall and having another year ruined due to the variant and things just going in the wrong direction just like what happened to my senior year. But I also have a fear that Im being selfish by trying to have a normal year and just live life carefree, that would put people/the community in danger. How do I combat these fears mentally?",

We set up for a bbq and were drinking beers, we let each other try the beers we each got etc. I left in the early evening and went home an hour away. She was up that night with a high fever and puking she told me yesterday. I knew it was gonna end up covid and told my employer I'd been exposed. The CDC doesnt require isolation for vaccinated people who have been exposed so I'm at work still with my mask on. I got the JnJ in March. I'm not sure how effective it is against the Delta variant as I hear it works, but am also seeing in my area there's been a lot of breakthrough cases for some reason. I was just reading an article yesterday about a weird outbreak among the vaccinated in the state above me where she lives. Just looking for some support or facts on whether I'm relatively safe or not. It'd be one thing if it was a brief exposure, but we spent 2 days together eating and drinking etc. I'm also worried about her as she has an autoimmune disorder and she woke up today with weird bruising. I don't know. This whole past year and a half has been awful.",

Im not worried about what is in the vaccines, I know whats in them, they seem relatively safe. Im not overly worried about the side effects because they are mild in most cases. My family are all vaccinated and they are all completely fine. Here is where my anxiety comes from. Im scared of what these vaccines could maybe, *maybe*, end up causing in the future. According to my own research on the subject, Vaccines cant really cause things like cancer or anything. But, there is no guarantee that the vaccines wont cause a different serious illness. Im insanely conflicted. This new delta variant is honestly terrifying me, people younger than me are dying because of it, and Im only 18! I want to get vaccinated, I really do, I want protection from this horrific virus but Im really nervous. Id just like some support, maybe somebody more knowledgeable on the subject could help put my anxieties to rest. Thank you in advance.",

I was hopeful to be able to maybe start and go do small things like outdoor farmers markets (with my child) or even possibly to go into a store (haven't been since before lockdown). With restrictions lifted, it makes the world seem a lot scarier for me to bring my child out there. He hasn't been able to tolerate a mask due to sensory issues - so we have only been to essential dr appointments. Lately, even things like having maintenance or contractors come into my apartment to fix long standing overdue issues seems too hard and I'm avoiding it because my child is unvaccinated and they technically don't have to wear masks inside my apartment I guess. How are those of you with kids navigating all of this? We haven't gotten take out or been in a store this entire time and I know I need to somehow ease back into life and existence because maintaining this level of isolation is really starting to damage my mental health to the point where I don't even know how to interact in the world anymore. We drove past a busy ice cream place a few nights ago and instead of thinking about stopping and enjoying life - I cried. Seeing everyone without masks, close together, kids everywhere - and knowing my little kid isn't protected is so hard. It sends me into a full panic and I feel left behind in this scary place where I have lost all sense of what's safe, what's not and no idea how to move ahead while life just keeps going past and we sit in the same spot. My child has missed out on absolutely everything and I want him to have some normalcy, but I also want to be responsible and limit his exposure as much as possible. Other parents seem ok to travel and be out and about with their kids and I am just totally afraid to do the smallest things.",

I have a weekend trip planned with a friend that I haven't seen in almost 2 years. I'm traveling from Seattle, WA and going to Spokane, WA. On day 1 we planned to stay at her place, and on day 2 we planned to stay in downtown Spokane and share a hotel room. I assumed she was vaccinated and agreed to these plans weeks ago. Once plans were settled I made sure to confirm vaccination status between us and she said that she is NOT vaccinated. I'm not entirely sure how safe it is to be around someone indoors and outdoors when they're unvaccinated. I'd also like to mention that my boyfriend has cystic fibrosis (hes vaccinated) and I'm worried about coming home and figuring out what precautions I need to take for that. Unvaccinated individuals in Washington state all have to wear masks in public, and while vaccinated individuals don't, the CDC website doesn't really go into broad descriptions on my specific concerns in their FAQ's section. Is it completely unreasonable to avoid staying at her place, and that I get my own separate hotel room? Will she need to continue to wear a mask around me while we're indoors hanging out, or in the car?? How should we proceed with hanging out outside?",

From what it looks like Los Angeles has not yet completed its round of vaccinations. There are still Latinos and others who have yet to receive the shot. L.A. isn't where it needs to be just yet. So of course the restrictions are coming back. That said, does this mean the same thing will happen everywhere in the United States? No. There are other regions that are highly vaccinated where such mandates will probably not be necessary. Aside from Los Angeles, where else in California have masks been mandated? That said if you are vaccinated, you are still well protected. And better yet, if you live in a region where the virus is not circulating, then of course it's safe to take off your mask. Highland Park in NJ is one such place. NJ is also one of the highly vaccinated states, so it's not facing much danger. Once again, this is just UNVACCINATED people. Does it mean these restrictions are going to be forever and that we'll never get our lives back? Does it mean we'll have to live like this forever? No and no. And a thousand times no. Fact: the children's vaccine is coming for September. Remember? THAT is another pocket of unvaccinated people who need to take the shot. Only then can we start to make anymore dents. That said, if you live in Los Angeles County, I understand how you feel. It IS heartbreaking, and it's unfortunate it's come down to this. But simultaneously, it's just a reminder that more people have to be vaccinated over there. And I'm sorry you have to go through this. But once again, we will NOT have to do this forever. There is still a good chance that this will all be over by the end of the year. Do not -- I repeat, DO NOT -- give up hope. This WILL end.",

It's one big room and they only have 2-3 staff present with not more than three patients at a time. Okay, that's all fine and dandy, but today I walked in and they're finishing up with a new patient who is wearing his mask under his nose. My first thought is just the usual eye roll and judgements about people who behave this way. Then I come to terms with the fact that they were treating him and allowing this behavior, which IMO makes their mask policy complete BS. So, here's the thing, I'm vaccinated but I have a medically at-risk kid who is too young to get jabbed. Delta spread is high in our county and from what I've read, it might be more transmittable even by vaccinated people. I'm about halfway through my expected treatment and seeing good progress. I also really like my therapist. But, honestly I 'm feeling like I don't want to step foot back in that place. I'm torn between just cancelling the rest of my appointments or how I might confront them about the issue?",

The results from the trial for kids 5-11 are not going to be until September. Waiting an additional 4 months after that would be absolutely disastrous for both children AND schools. Considering that some schools are not requiring mask mandates I fear the consequences will be stiff. That's why I would prefer for the vaccine to come out sooner than that so that we do not have disasters like this happen. As someone who works with kids, I am very, very concerned about this and do not want to see children continue to be deprived of this vaccine for any longer than necessary.",

Is the Delta Variant a problem, yes. But only for unvaccinated. That's all. They also said masking is only advisable in areas where there are low vaccination rates, not high ones. As disappointing as it is about L.A., keep in mind that this is on account of half the population not being highly vaccinated. So while they didn't say anything we didn't already know, they are still using calming rhetoric. Which isn't to say you should drop your guard in an unvaccinated area. There's a reason for that. But having said that, they ARE working at trying to get more people vaccinated. The Delta Variant is NOT a reset presser, just another obstacle. But it IS one that CAN be overcome with more vaccinations. The more we do so the better. So try not to obsess too much about this if you're vaccinated and continue to live your life. Don't panic so much, keep in mind, we will still be able to crush this virus and end the pandemic. Nobody should lose faith now.",

My mother also questions covid a lot, she does 'believe' it exists as well, she's not entirely against all the measurements (apart from a few obvious ridiculous ones we have to deal with here in Southern Spain) however my sister convinced her to also not take the vaccine (my mother is 63). On another side note, my father does 'believe' it all and even got his 2nd second as of 2 weeks ago.

I really don't want that to happen, it would feel like falling just before the finish of a marathon. However, I can't just lock myself up for 3 weeks, because I have my lil' job as a postwoman. Even if I could just stay home, I live with my dear SO who wouldn't agree with being locked up, and I get that, it'd be extreme. Also, I've been hearing someone who lives above or next to us (I'm not sure) coughing horribly this whole day. Every time I hear it my mind becomes anxious. It's such a nasty cough and it makes me think about covid immediately :(( It comes so close this way, eventhough there's a wall - luckily!",

I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it. I know I shouldn't be this nervous and scared, but the recent news of the Delta HAD shaken me somewhat and I am worried that I might end up catching the virus with the reports I'm hearing of people taking the vaccine getting sick from the virus still. I'm sorry I sound like I'm such a mess, but I felt scared throughout and I wanted to have some opinions on whether I put myself in danger or not.",

The CDC is disgraceful for only counting breakthrough cases that result in hospitalization or death, and not actual cases. They dont realize that even mild or asymptotic cases can still have a negative effect on ones body. I really think we need to do more research on just how many breakthrough cases there are after full vaccination. I know vaccines arent 100% and they never will be, but infection shouldnt be very common either, otherwise we are clearly seeing waning immunity or resistance to variants, and boosters should be looked into. I personally am worried about breakthrough cases, even mild ones, since I dont want to have a loss of taste and smell or even long covid. It has not yet been proven definitively if vaccines prevent long covid should you come into contact with covid 19 after vaccination. I feel like they should have waited to make the vaccines, if they could have, until they knew more about the virus, but we couldnt wait due to dramatic loss of life. Even still, Im happy they approved the vaccines so quickly.",

        "Reddit Post": "My dad died back in January of Covid-19, after spending a month in the hospital and 2 weeks in a medically-induced coma. I couldn't travel for the funeral because, well, pandemic. I booked a hotel for the end of July because I figured we'd all be vaccinated by then and it'd be reasonably safe to travel. My mom needs help dealing with my dad's stuff, and I want to pick out some mementos of my favorite parent. I think I was wrong. I'm vaccinated (<ORG>) and my mother and sibling are, too (moderna+natural immunity). The rest of Kentucky is sucking at vaccination. Where I live: [2.6 daily new cases per 100k people, 64% at least partially vaccinated]([url] Where they are: [16 new cases daily per 100k people. 39% at least partially vaccinated]([url] The plan is to drive 15 hours, stay in a hotel, and cook in the room or get takeout. Masks with filters, hand sanitizer obsessively. Avoid my partner for a week once I get back, masking whenever in common areas. If anyone gives me grief about masking, just tell them \"Hi, for context: I'm halfway through a 16-hour roadtrip to help my mom pick out my dad's headstone. What was it you needed to tell me?\" (I'm autistic. Scripts are good.) Is this too risky? I can still cancel the hotel and rebook later. Antsy skippable backstory: I totally blame my mom for killing my dad. She brought Covid home after attending a \"mandatory work Christmas breakfast party\". My dad was definitely vulnerable to the disease, having a history of heart problems. I'm still very very upset and pissed at her. She's a narcissist that's been playing the \"grieving widow\" card since before my dad died. While he was in a coma, she whined to me that dating as a widow is such a balancing act: date too soon and people judge you for it. Date too late and people think you're just so sad. Anyway, lots of emotions. Thanks in advance for your advice.",

I thought that I would get some peace when I got the vaccine (as did all the people I generally come in contact with at any great length) and could stop worrying so much. But then they start talking about breakthrough infections or people who are immuno-suppressed not as protected. Not sure where that leaves me as I have no spleen. I do get plenty of white blood cells when I have some issue, but don't know if that is the same as a broken immune system as it relates to COVID. No one seems to have a straight answer, although I do know there are studies working on that question. On top of that, my housemate, who is vaccinated as well, got a new job at a popular restaurant in town that apparently doesn't have any mask requirements. They didn't even ask if she'd been vaccinated, which means that they probably hire those that aren't. She is excited for the job, but I'm worried that she'll pick up the delta variant as now they say that even casual encounters can get someone infected. And I'm worried that she'll bring home the virus and I'll be compromised, even though I hope neither of us would wind up sick enough to be hospitalized or die. Not to mention going to Walmart was like a nightmare this morning. I was wearing a mask, but it seemed like I was one of the few. Our county is only 27% vaccinated and yet 90% of the people there had no masks because since they lifted the mask requirements, everybody's honor seems to have gone awry. I almost had a panic attack when a guy without a mask coughed near me and the guy got too close. I hate having to be scared of the idea that someone's breath could be like a bullet to the brain, only more agonizing.

        "Reddit Post": "So, long story short, I am in the US to get a vaccine. I'm not living here and I have a small window of time. Got my first shot, my next one is a little over a week away. After that I have just enough time to let it kick in (to be honest, a couple days short, I messed up my flights a bit) before I fly out again. My luck has been horrific for this whole pandemic though, and of course I can't count on anything going well, so I'm unsurprised that I have managed to crack an entire molar and I need to get it looked at urgently. In spite of being pretty good about my dental hygiene in the past, I've put off my annual dentist check ups for two years because of this shitty pandemic. I kind of have to do something about this, but I'm scared. Rationally I know I have some protection nearly two weeks out from my first jab, and there's a strong chance that the dentists I see here would all have been vaccinated ages ago. I guess I could try to push it off even longer, but when I return to my home country, I'm going to a place where there are way less vaccinations that have been distributed, so I think I'd be more nervous. My luck isn't great and this year has been super hard, I just don't want it to get worse if I can help it at all. Most other doctors visits wouldn't be as scary because I could mask up accordingly... but this is mentally tricky, it's the one thing where I suddenly have to have my mouth wide open around a bunch of strangers for an unknown procedure. My partner is encouraging me to just go now, even though I'm waiting for my second shot, because it's really not great to have this. So, I'm bracing myself, because I think my partner is correct, but my anxiety is firing on all cylinders. Does anyone have some reassurance around going and getting dental work done? Words of encouragement? Has anyone had to go do some emergency dental work during the pandemic?",

My other friend and I who I live with immediately started isolating, informed my work and they told me to keep coming in. Around Wednesday friend started showing symptoms, we both got tests Thursday and results yesterday. He was positive I was negative so he went into isolation in his room. This morning I woke up with aches and took my temp and it was higher than normal 100.9. Not too bad but am fairly certain it means I have covid. They've both lost their senses of taste, the first friend had more symptoms she had a high fever and was puking, fatigued, says today it's hard to breathe but she's fine otherwise. Friend I live with has a cough qnd headaches and congestion but energy is fine. I turn 30 in 2 days, the whole thing just sucks. If it's rare how did we all get it? We've all been fully vaxxed for a couple months. I feel like I just never understand what's happening even though I'm constantly reading about it. Just venting I guess",

And then there's people saying \"lock down until a certain % are vaccinated\" but here in America we've basically hit the ceiling. Anyone who wanted to be vaccinated has been vaccinated. Now what? Literally everyone around me has expressed how awful the past year and a half has been. Teenagers who have fallen into a depression and lost all their social skills, kids who lost their precious childhood years, adults who are overwhelmed with zero outside support, the elderly in nursing homes where they can't be visited.

Our son on the other hand is only 4, and can't get vaccinated. We know the risk to him is low and that he's very likely to be fine if he does get it. We've been seeing our immediate family members and close friends who are all vaccinated, but we've stayed away from everyone we know who isn't vaccinated. The issue were having is that the majority of both of our families are anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. One of our friends in our usual group is anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. Most of them, especially the ones that want to see us, acted like covid didn't exist and were out all the time. These people now want to see us, or are being invited to all the functions so the only way to avoid them is to not go. My MIL, and some of our other vaccinated friends are giving us a hard time and making us feel like we're being ridiculous by not seeing our unvaccinated family and friends. So my question is are we being ridiculous? Are we being overly cautious when we shouldn't be? Because a lot of people are making us feel like we are. We know the chances of him getting really sick are low, but also realize that the people who want to see us/him are not taking any precautions and seeing a ton of other non-vax people. They also are the type of people that won't work with us by taking precautions themselves. Tl;Dr- Wife and I are vaccinated, 4 year old isn't. Unvaccinated family/friends want us to hang out with them with our son. Are we being ridiculous by not wanting to take our son around anti-covid vaxers who also don't wear masks and go out all the time and hang out with a ton of other anti-vaxers?",

Ive since pursued counseling for my anxiety and depression, and this combined with the pandemic situation getting better has helped a ton with my mental health issues. However, now theyre saying this Delta variant is going to make things bad again, and it almost feels like were going to end up back at square one again (even as someone who is fully vaccinated again).

I've been reading about the breakthrough cases with Delta and it's making me a little nervous than I was about a month or so ago. Especially since I am in Florida where cases or more or less on the rise. I know the vaccines arent 100% effective, but It just makes me very nervous to be going on a plane knowing that the Delta Variant is spreading. Luckily if I were to get it, my mom and everyone around me is vaccinated, so that helps. But, I watched a Tik Tok Video of someone saying that they caught a covid breakthrough case, and I keep reading stuff on Reddit about covid breakthrough cases, and my mom is watching like CNN and well it's CNN. Should I honestly be that concerned about becoming a breakthrough case?",

According to graphs in Scotland, the variant may hit hard and fast, but it ultimately doesn't do as bad a damage as other variants. In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy. That's attributed to how much vaccinations we have made. The more people we do this to, the better. I hope I am not giving any false hopes, but this post DID have me intrigued.",

Anyway I saw this article today on NBC news as website and believe it or not it makes me feel a whole lot better. According to this article 27 states have kept monitoring their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations have started. According to this the totals are around 65,000, though to be fair thats not accurate since more than likely theres many more of those other 23 states so for the sake of argument lets assume that all of those other states have the exact same amount so will make our maximum amount 130,000. Then we extrapolate that against the 160 MILLION who are fully vaccinated. That means that statistically 99.92% of people with full vaccinations have not gotten breakthrough infections.

Majority of my peers tell me they have been experiencing heart problems ever since they got the vaccine which terrifies me and I am also scared for them! I know they say the risk is so small but I don't want to be added to that number. They literally recommended me not to get vaccinated, and then the people online call me an idiot because I am not.

One of the friends girlfriends wasnt feeling well so she skipped the happy hour. Again it was outdoors and we are all vaxxed!! Yesterday, my husband developed a dry cough. Went away overnight. However, he woke up around 3am feeling feverish. Feverish feeling went away but hes been sneezy today. I just have a scratchy throat, but I always have a scratchy throat due to allergies and living in Austin. Today I found out that one of the people we met up with on Friday tested positive thru antigen test but they feel like they just have allergies. So multiple exposures we probably have covid. What would be the point in getting tested? Mask mandates were finally lifted at my office but Im putting mine back on just to protect others. Im just feeling so discouraged about our future as a society. I want people to feel safe again. But all of this makes it seem like the vaccines dont work. We are also having our postponed wedding ceremony in October. We postponed from this May because we wanted people to ease back into normalcy and we werent sure people would have access to the vaccines! Doubt anyone will be excited to come now.",

Rather than inform employees, management/HR did all they could to keep new cases under wraps, so those who were in contact were not made aware of the risk. This obviously blew up in their face and there was no one to work for 2 months. There was never even any formal acknowledgement let alone apology for this incredible lapse in judgement. And <PERSON> doesn't believe there was ever any sort of investigation into the event, if that's a thing. Since then there has been significant turnover, with many new people who presumably have not yet been infected. Well apparently it's happening AGAIN, and the only reason any employees are aware are from sharing info with each other. Admin makes no effort to reach out to those working in proximity to others who may be sick, and are giving no explanation for why certain employees are mysteriously gone, not even to managers of said employees. It's complete lunacy, and <PERSON> has no idea what to do. He fears inaction, if not retaliation if talking directly to management. Is there some organization that he can report this to? To protect himself and other workers? This is in SoCal btw. Please let me know if I can provide more information, I was trying to crank this out as fast as I could. Thank you...",

Where I'm from they dropped the mask mandate for shopping under 7-day-case-rates of 10 and I'm also more and more surrounded by people who flaunt masks and precautions when needed/mandated- I feel as if it's already useless to argue with them. I suffer from pandemic fatigue more and more and I don't feel as if my behavior would benefit anyone anymore. I'm not one of those people who never cared - I cared for the last 1.5 years. But the longer it goes, my solidarity decreases. Then add the fact that I'm vaccinated already, but recently I'm more and more reading bad news regarding Delta vs the vaccines.

I'm not a social butterfly by any means and have had social anxiety in the past, but I was just starting to enjoying being around people, socializing after work etc pre-COVID. Now myself and colleagues (1000+) have been told that on return, we can come into the office and work, but all teams will be mixed together, and most people will be working from home - probably just a few. This means that I'll be working with a handful of people (who I don't work directly and do different roles completely). What makes me feel worse is that most people don't want to return to work. They have families, friends and good home lives which means not going into an office is no great loss to them. But for me, it *was* my social life. I know I shouldn't be complaining, I have a job, I've not got COVID and I'm surviving. But it makes me depressed and I guess I'm just mourning the loss of the trajectory my life was going pre-COVID",

I can't just go and tell people it's over and you'll never have to worry again, not when I don't think those are the facts. I know this is a support community, but support does not mean lying through your teeth to make people feel better! My perspective is that this is a serious crisis, but we are smart and strong and we can get through it. I want to offer realistic ideas about what the future will look like and useful tips to help people get through it. It bothers me that people seem to want me to say, \"Nothing bad will happen, you are perfectly safe, you can guarantee the safety of everyone around you, the pandemic will never hurt you,\" or, \"No, you'll never have to miss an event or wear a mask again,\" because those things just aren't true. They're comforting in the moment, but they only set you up for disappointment. I would prefer to say, \"You've been keeping yourself safer this way and this other way,\" or, \"Your mask might help keep your town from needing a lockdown,\" or, \"There are safer ways to socialize so you don't have to stay away from your friends.\" Maybe I don't get it, but isn't support supposed to be realistic? I would hate to be lied to. Always did, even as a little kid. Like, I wanted to know that the shot would hurt but that it wouldn't last long or be very painful; I didn't want to be lied to and told it wouldn't hurt a bit, and then feel betrayed when it did.",

They are all gathering, with other family members (some vaccinated some not) for a belated wake, and I made the decision not to go. In March of 2020, my husband and I had to decide not to travel when his father passed, because the risk of spreading covid to his mother/family was too great. Even though we are vaccinated now, too many of my family have chosen not to get vaccinated, and for the same reasons we held in March 2020, I dont want to either potentially transmit the delta variant to my mother, or be exposed to it- in the event my <ORG> vaccine is in need of a booster. My mother, of course does not understand my decision and cries every day when I talk to her. So of course I feel incredibly guilty, and also angry that my family is being insane. It feels like a crack in the foundation of our relationship is gaping open. I have no idea how to fix it or cope, and I just needed to vent, so thank you.",

It is clear that this delta variant is incredibly contagious but maybe not as strenuous to the healthcare system? After two to three months of normalcy, I fear that as a society, we will regress into our pre-vaccinated behavior. I dont know if that is the right move. How will we ever know if we need updated vaccines if we are all wearing masks again? Obviously children and immunocompromised need to take more precautions, but this is all feeling like two steps back. And please dont tell me that at least the death toll and hospitalization rates arent skyrocketing at the same rate. I am worried about our collective societys mental health. My friends that I have spoken to that recently tested positive and have mild symptoms despite being vaccinated are feeling betrayed by the vaccine. I dont think we should be feeling this way. I also understand a big source of anger is that so many unvaccinated people caused this spike. I feel like this argument is so futile because shouldnt have this been part of the equation or formula making?

Like everything is backsliding. Since J&amp;J and <PERSON> were dropped from the vaccine program here and given to a private company, those of us who received them are not on the regular vaccine plan anymore. At least not for this round, nothing has been planned for booster shots yet. So I can't just go and book a different shot. I already am terrified of my dad dying, especially dying after I have not seen him in over a year and a half. I also have elderly grandparents, my grandad is 91, who knows how long he has left? Now I am terrified this news will lead to J&amp;J being considered invalid in the EU and/or UK, I am already being kept away right now due to the UK only allowing people vaccinated inside the UK to non have to quarantine 10 days (but they allow nightclubs to be open?? \"Freedom day\" is also terrifying me), now even if that gets lifted I might still be screwed. This just feels like it is never going to end, and I feel with how so much of the world still has no access to vaccines we're going to get more and more variants that destroy our progress for getting some normalcy back.",

Knew I probably shouldn't go but I knew I was vaccinated so I thought I'd be fine. Fast forward to Sunday evening and im getting some fatigue/body aches and a scratchy throat. I've been dealing with some chronic acid reflux &amp; asthma stuff since March 2020 and have had spells of scratchy throats and body aches before so I figured it was just another one of those popping up. They usually went away in a day or two. The thought of going to the wrestling show was still in the back of my mind though. By Monday night I had a cough and congested sinuses. So finally this morning I got up and did a rapid test and sure enough it came back positive. Told everyone I went to the show with and everyone I'd seen since (including my parents ugh) and all got tested today or are getting tested tomorrow. Most from today have come back negative thankfully. So now im just sitting here with a sore throat, cough, stuffy nose and sinus headache crossing my fingers that it doesn't get any worse and that I didn't end up infecting my parents. Any other recovered breakthroughers on here? How long after the onset of your symptoms did it take to get better? \\--- Since writing this yesterday I've started to have some trouble breathing and 2 instances of coughing up white mucus. Still no fever and I have a pulse oximiter and my oxygen has been bouncing mostly between 98 &amp; 99, but occasionally dropping to 97 - not super worried yet there. Hoping this is the worst of it but preparing for more.",

        "Reddit Post": "An argument I often hear with regards to our path towards herd immunity is that there could be natural immunity on top of vaccinations. And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people. Is there something missing from my logic here? [I have heard that viruses will eventually reach a point of \"peak fitness\"]([url] where it has evolved to optimal survival conditions. Maybe this is what will break the cycle?",

I feel like a horrible mother because I wont let him go, we only go to the parks and those even turn into fights because they want to do more. Please Im not sure what to do at this point, my heart hurts for my children. I have one thats wants to leave but blames me because he has no where to go. And one thats 15 that really just keeps to herself.",

My husband and I are both double vaccinated but our children are not (all under 12). Unfortunately, my husbands grandmother passed away a couple days ago in another province and he is already talking about traveling for the service. We have been super careful through out the pandemic as I have an immune condition so curbside pick up, remote learning and distancing from our family and friends (with the exception of outdoor visits) has been our norm. While my husband would travel alone, this is a BIG change for us. He seems quite comfortable going-me not so much. I'm concerned about the delta variant. I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off on travel until our whole family was vaccinated but that doesn't appear to be an option. Any thoughts?",

I havent eaten at a restaurant, havent seen friends, wear a mask wherever I go, still treat mail as though it can contain virus (even though theres research to show its unlikely to catch COVID from touching a surface). I know that even if I did get COVID, it would be mild since Im vaccinated. Still, I cant help but continue to be anxious, especially with the probably third wave were entering in the US. I feel like on one hand I should loosen up - see vaccinated friends/family, for example - and accept the risk of getting sick with a mild illness. But the other part of me feels like I just dont want to ever get COVID, period. A lot of my friends and family have been giving me a hard time for not seeing them, so I feel like Im just being crazy/paranoid.

Just a background: I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer but these are the circumstances that force me to ask myself this question. I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.",

        "Reddit Post": "Hello. I apologize beforehand for making yet another question about this subject. But I can't seem to find specific information that relates to my particular case... I am a Mexican citizen studying in France. While in France, some months ago I got vaccinated with <ORG>, yet they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December and officially that's how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. Though honestly this left me a bit concerned since not all countries have this policy, as far as I know... I'm back in Mexico for the summer and vaccinations for the youth will begin next week in my city, offering <ORG>, <ORG>, Sputnik V and Sinovac. I'm considering on registering and taking my \"second dose\" here. Specially if it were <ORG> since I've read that mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies. My parents say I shouldn't \"risk it\" since according to France I'm fully vaccinated already. But my girlfriend is immunosupressed and it's always a little scary being close to her since because of my work I am out on the street often and she needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. Can anyone help assessing me on making this choice? Thanks beforehand.",

We were able to make it work because our retired/semi-retired parents were able to take on several days of childcare/week. My spouse and I are both working from home, so the days we didn't have coverage we just made do taking turns watching him and made up for time missed on other days of the week. It wasn't easy but it worked for over a year. He's 3 now. In May, vaccinations were looking good, cases were plummeting, and it seemed like the right time to send him back to school. We toured a preschool that said they had only had a single case of COVID in a student the entire pandemic and everything seemed good safety-wise. Well, he started 3 weeks ago going on a part-time basis 3 days per week. Of course, the numbers have been getting worse and worse. And today we were informed that we had to come pick him up because a classmate of his, who had attended school while symptomatic, tested positive for COVID. The 2nd child to text positive in the last year and a half in the whole school, and it happened in my son's classroom after he had been to school no more than 7 times. I'm devastated. We worked so hard to keep him safe for so long, it feels pointless now. He has no symptoms yet and I hope it stays that way. We will have to get him tested, which will be traumatic, as he has been swabbed before and it's awful. And vaccines for his age group seem so far away, it feels like even if he escapes this time, COVID is looming around the corner waiting for him. We live in a red state where vaccinations have stalled. Just feeling hopeless.",

All the focus has been on survival, and they dont care about quality of life afterwards. Im not sure that I want to survive if I couldnt smell or taste ever again and I had neurological problems and stuff. Meanwhile, all of my vaccinated (I hope/assume) friends have decided that the pandemic is over now, and I feel like I have to choose between protecting my health or everybody moving on without me. Im in improv comedy, and all the theaters are plowing ahead with unmasked performances in little rooms with low ventilation, and a month ago, I would have been excited, but the delta variant (and the gamma, which is also in Chicago for some fucking reason) has changed my risk tolerance. And nobody elses. I dont want to lose my friends and all the wonderful things I got to do from April to last week, but I dont want to lose my health either.",

At the beginning of the year, I've noticed other people I live with don't wash their hands for long enough, definitely nowhere near the advised 20 seconds. This has been becoming a bigger and bigger issue for me recently, as the thought of contaminating myself or my belongings makes me feel stressed and really anxious. It's reached a point where I don't feel safe touching most items in my house without washing my hands right after. I feel like it makes no sense feeling this way, considering there's been very few cases in my town this summer. I wanted to know, is it worth spending as much time as I do trying to keep me and my stuff as clean as possible or should I try going back to a normal way of living, without having to worry so much about everything I touch?",

Ok, so this will be a bit long maybe. So, today our State Goverment announced that they received 134,400 doses of vaccines for the City Metropolitan area, for people of age 30 to 39 (Total population of the urban area: around 5.35 million). However, the issue is: the vaccine the federal goverment is sending is Sinovac (Previously they where sending <ORG> and <PERSON>, and for the teachers they send Cansino). Unfortunately while searching for information, i got the data that the efficiency of Sinovac is barely above 50% And IDK what to think or to do. IMO the best is efficiency above 70% that most vaccines get. This would mean that if i got Sinovac, I will still need to keep isolated for a longer time and i'm getting extremely tired for that. And also the rumors run that Sinovac isn't effective enought against Delta Variant, that seems to be the variant raising here at Mxico. I still don't have the money or the visa to travel USA to get a shot from another brand, i would have done that if i had the resources. But i'm feeling \"tied\" since our freaking federal goverment its handling all at worst. I know that 50% chance is better than 0, but in the long term, not sure how good will be. A friend told me that might be also the chance to get later another vaccine so perhaps get 2 vaccines and might be better, but i'm feeling somehow anxious. The good news is that my family, the ones who worried me more since they are risk population, already got vaccinated with <ORG> and <PERSON>, and even plannig to go overseas once the pandemic stabilize, so it's one thing to worry less. However, now i need to think on myself, but this situation is getting into my head.",

She's been sharing a room with their parents (her sister and her brother in law) and sharing meals with the nephews. The players are tested regularly and last week one of the nephews tested positive. He's asymptomatic. His father and brother have tested negative so far. Sister in law was negative on a rapid test this morning and has a PCR result due tomorrow. If negative, she plans to travel here. She would be hoping to stay in our house with the elderly aunt and uncle and visit my mother in her assisted living home.

        "Reddit Post": "Before I let this out of the way, I've took the virus serious since last spring. I masked up, maintained my distance, and took the vaccine because it's safe and effective and that makes me enough to trust it. May 2021. It was a week after my Vegas trip. Also around when the CDC called on us fully vaccinated people that we can stop masking up if we like. I remembered having a dry throat at first, but I didn't mind it because I was still talking just fine and I wasn't feeling all miserable. I'm not a doctor, but I believe to think that it's much less contagious than even the flu, let alone Covid-19. And then a day or two after that, I had a very runny nose that wouldn't stop. I remembered masking at Fred Meyer, mainly because it was required, but not at the other two. I had no fever, no coughing, no body pain, no sweating, no diarrhea, nothing major. My dad and my brother had it too with no serious symptoms, but I don't recall my mother having it for some reason. Have any of you ever even remembered about masks on sinus infections before 2020? Like....ever? Because a sinus infection is now where NEAR the levels that is Covid and the flu. I'd even mask up for the flu because that's a miserable time. I doubt people will mask up for the flu every single season, though. I just don't expect it all, depending where I live. Am I just ruminating and overthinking this out of the blue?",

After doing a lot of research to questions I had regarding the vaccines I felt more comfortable finally booking to get one. It seemed like they are/were working. Lockdowns were being lifted, I saw online people doing things social and doctors celebrating etc. I avoid the news about covid for my mental health. Pretty much what I find out about the pandemic pops up on my feed. Now Im seeing so much conflicting information at the same time and Im confused and defeated. UK says pfizer vaccine is 88% effective against delta variant but is that only against hospitalizations? What about actually getting it and suffering? Israel says pfizer went from 64% to 39% . This may not be helpful but Ive recently read about a lot of people on reddit who are fully vaccinated getting covid - and what concerns me more is a lot of them are saying its kicking their ass. Why are they making it seem like on the news and in research that getting covid after vaccinated IF YOU DO is mild like sniffles? This is extremely concerning and Im feeling very discouraged and hopeless about this situation. I miss my family. So much has changed in my life since the pandemic started and I still dont see it going away any time soon. Even after Im vaccinated I still have to worry !? This truly fucking sucks.",

First two days: Cold Third day: Dry cough Fourth day: Mild dry cough Fifth day: Mild dry cough and mild cold In our country, there are only few people with the Delta variant - around 120. She hasn't experienced her loss of taste and smell, which brings me to wonder - is it possible she has the Delta variant, or is it also normal that she still has her taste and smell? I've googled online, but they're just saying that not losing your sense of taste and smell means your symptoms are more severe, which I fear, but highly doubt. Her symptoms so far are relatively mild so far, but of course, only time will tell. Apologies if I seem like I'm rambling. I'm only 16 and extremely worried. I know she's already vaccinated, but it would still be great to hear everyone's much-needed advice.",

Havent been to a bar, restaurant, nothing. Very few social gatherings but theyve been outdoors. I returned to work first week of June 2021 upon my boss request since I was vaccinated. I was all for it as I needed a normal schedule back in my life quarantine schedule was literally killing me I think. Now while neither of my bosses have taken this super seriously, my one boss is at least vaccinated. My other boss isnt. He got Covid once before and now was apparently exposed to it at some point last week when he played golf with his uncle (who runs our corporate office one town over). His uncle has Covid-19 fully. Unaware of his vaxx status. Anyway, I found this out through back channels and context clues. My actual two bosses did not disclose this to me. The one that was exposed (likely this past Thursday) I have not seen in person since Wednesday. However, he was in the office Friday while I was not. The one that was exposed is working from home today and the next several. Has anyone else encountered this type of situation and if so what did you do? My sanity doesnt want me to work from home again but my fear and anxiety are slowly taking back over. Any suggestions on what to do? For reference, by the way, our branch is a very small group. Today for example there are only 3 people here including me and we all have our own closed door offices. I only share a bathroom with one other person who is fully vaxxed.",

Heres some takeaways from it: As you can see, new cases have risen only modestly among people over 65, suggesting that breakthrough infections are rare. I think people who are vaccinated are not, on a population level, major contributors to the transmission of the disease, Dr. David Dowdy, a Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist, told me What is clear is that people who are vaccinated and have symptomatic breakthrough infections can transmit it to other people, Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University said. What is not at all clear is whether vaccinated asymptomatic people can transmit it. And my best guess is no or not very often. He added: Im not worried about an asymptomatic vaccinated person spreading it to me. Its also important that the country not respond in ways that would do more harm than good say, by delaying the full reopening of schools, Dowdy added. For vaccinated people, Covid still represents a very small risk, and the cost of our response should not exceed the benefits. I hope this helps somebodyit surely helped me.",

        "Reddit Post": "I'm really struggling mentally with the Delta resurgence. That feels better to say that.... 6 months ago we decided to rent a house (VRBO) at the beach for a getaway. There's no boardwalk and the beach isn't packed. It's a family atmosphere. It's just me and my wife and 2 kids. My wife and I are fully vaccinated. 1 kid just got the 2nd shot and the other is too young to get vaccinated. We aren't planning any activities beyond sitting on the beach and enjoying time away from home. We still aren't dining in at restaurants and we wear masks indoors. I'm not too concerned about the beach since it is outdoors and we can maintain more than 6' of distance from everyone. I can't shake a fear about the rental house. I don't know who was in it before us. In theory, they are leaving at 11am, a cleaning crew will come in, then we can arrive at 4. That's a lot of presumably unmasked people in a space that I'm about to inhabit. It's probably irrational, but I don't want to sit on the couch, or use dishes, etc... I'm scared of the air conditioning. I know that sounds silly. We are planning to wash the sheets and towels when we get there since 1 kid is allergic to a few detergents. I see the numbers, usually a percentage, and I don't understand them. It's hard for me to interpret. I never see it as odds like 1 out of every so many people will get delta. I know a few people that are vaccinated that still got Delta, I read about it every day. I don't really understand what the chances are that we catch it. I really want to relax in the house, but I am freaked out. I've spent 18 months in a bubble in my house and I don't know how to get out of it. I know this seems silly. I'm embarrassed to feel this way. I want to get away and create fun memories with my wife and kids. What are the real risks of the rental house and what can I do to mitigate them?",

There's a few more articles on this, which I'll link below, but seeing this really helped me feel better today. In recent days I've been getting really worried that Delta would lead to my school once again cancelling in-person classes/activities for the fall, given how restrictive they've been throughout the pandemic. However, if this were true, it would mean that this current surge in the US peaks around mid-August, significantly sooner than the September/October peak I've heard previously, and would mean that the worst will be behind us by the time the fall semester starts. I think this is definitely a good sign for the US. Here's some other articles on this: [[url] [[url]",

Another big reason is the surge in other viruses. Since we were all wearing masks for so long, there is a crazy unexpected surge in viruses that were more or less dormant while masked up. We sent our toddler to part time daycare in early June and he almost immediately got an upper respiratory infection. After he recovered, we sent him back and he got hand foot and mouth disease. After he recovered from that, he got RSV, which my whole family, including my infant, now has. We were on the verge of taking my infant to the hospital yesterday because he keeps throwing up, but are monitoring him at home per doctors advice. They said because of everyone being masked up for so long its just hitting everyone hard right now. Anyway, mask mandates will protect the selfish unvaccinated by choice crowd from COVID, but the rest of us who chose to get vaccinated so we can go maskless cant build up our immune systems, and end up catching everything else when we take our masks off. I know there are people who cant get vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated by choice. The idea of another masked up winter and virus-ridden 2022 summer is awful to me.",

Otherwise low viral rate places are perfectly safe to be maskless at. Just as I figured. They are only applying it to places where there are high case counts, not everywhere. That said, for those of you who think this is going to be forever. Its not. More people need to be vaccinated. Its the only way out. But worry not. More and more people are still getting vaccinated. Monday and Tuesdays numbers of those vaccinations may be low, but keep in mind they cover Saturday and Sunday. Once again this will NOT be permanent. Only temporary. Once we have enough vaccinated people masking will end. And it will be safe again, too.",

And now I feel like I'm spreading COVID-19 to my parents, despite myself getting vaccinated against it. Like, I know the best I'm going to experience is mild symptoms anytime I *do* get it, plus my parents are vaccinated as well, so either they'll experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all any time I spread it to them. But COVID-19 has the potential to mutate and thus evade our immune systems much more easily. And with that many unvaccinated people spreading it among each other for the sake of their otherwise nonexistent \"freedoms\", it's going to mutate and infect all of us vaccinated people and kill us all.

I dont trust the CDC, I dont trust <PERSON>, and I especially dont trust political figures (not that I ever trusted them). I was a big advocate for the CDC and <PERSON>, but now that you can read something where they say we need to go back to masking even the vaccinated, while in the same breath say vaccines are extremely effective, I feel like I cant trust what they say. The two ideas contradict themselves and Im tired of trying to figure out whats true and whats BS. All I know is I was wearing a mask before I was vaccinated and felt depressed and hopeless. I got the vaccine as soon as I was able to and was soon able to take my mask off, which made things feel a lot better. Now, I will soon be forced to put the mask back on. Is my vaccine not effective? If Im vaccinated and still have to wear a mask is that going to always be the case? The voices I once trusted seem to have more flip flops than a Shoe Carnival in Myrtle Beach. People keep saying this will soon be over, but how? Vaccines rates have hit a wall, variants are popping up like pimples on middle schooler, and we seem hellbent on protecting half the country that chooses not to protect themselves. Anyone else feel the same way? Advise on how to cope?",

From the numbers I have seen, it's somewhere around 1 in 20 young people who get COVID, will get \"long covid\". I've been vaccinated, AstroZeneca, two doses (I got it earlier than most young people, first does in March). However from the numbers I have seen, the AZ vaccine only has about 60-80% effectiveness, which is pretty high I guess but still leaves you a 1/4 chance of not being immune. Also I have read that being stressed can have a impact of how well vaccines work, and I have been very stressed for a long time now. I figure that, going to Uni, I'm going to be living in a flat with 4 other people, most young people don't seem to take COVID very seriously, so it's not that unlikely one of my flatmates gets it and then I get exposed to it at some point. Also pretty sure stress can further increase your chances of getting some lingering effects from covid, especially as I have been worried about stuff like brain fog in the past. I feel like if I get covid at all I'm going to end up with it, purely through psychosomatic symptoms at this point. Is there anything I am missing here that makes this something i need not worry about?",

I believe I saw the first posts about a \"pneumonia\" spreading through China on Reddit around that time and there was a sinking feeling in my stomach. For the first year of the pandemic me and my household were vigilant against the virus, none of us became infected, and in March myself, my partner, and my parents all got vaccinated. But I only got the first dose. Two days after I got the first dose of the vaccine I noticed that I started having petechiae rashes pop up, which terrified me. Since then I've had bloodwork done by my doctors, seen dermatologists, and had my anxiety increase tenfold. I've started seeing a therapist about this, and other things, and I'm set to see a hematologist at the end of August, but I'm still without a second dose and gripped with fear that I'll catch the delta variant and that it will hospitalize me or worse. I feel like I am slowly losing my mind, I don't feel like I'm the same person that I once was, and I feel like it's straining my relationship with my partner, with my family, and with my friends. I'm 28, overweight, addicted to nicotine and weed, but other than that moderately healthy (I've never had any other health issues), but from the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out at night there's this huge anxiety cloud over my head that this will end up being my demise. I want nothing more than for everything to check out okay and get my second dose and be protected but I feel like I'm living in a state of constant fear and it's tearing me apart.",

However, a few days ago, my college posted a new update on their mask guidance. Before, they had a mandate where masks were optional for the fully vaccinated. Now, they are required at all times indoors for the fully vaccinated, except when eating or drinking, in your dorm room, etc. My question is why is this necessary if over 96% of the people on campus will be fully vaccinated? I understand there are breakthrough cases, but does that really warrant necessary masks at all times indoors? I'm just really confused, and am hoping you all could help me understand why this is so necessary.",

Im vaccinated Im done wearing a mask, the news is off, Im annoyed at doom mongers, and Im living my life. That changed today. So just a bit ago, my best friend on Facebook who is from a country in North Africa and his entire family all got covid. That kinda spooked me but they werent vaccinated given their location but that still shook me up because of how close to home it felt. Then I found out my great uncle who is 81 with severe lung problems got a breakthrough case even though he was vaccinated. His wife got a breakthrough case too. My great uncle had to go to the hospital and he couldnt be discharged until they found a way for him to have oxygen at home. If he wasnt vaccinated he more than likely wouldnt have made it. That was really close to home. Then I saw the map of counties from red to orange to yellow to blue. I thought my county was colored yellow and there wasnt a reason to be concerned or quit living my life. Then my dad told me that our county is red and one of the worst Covid hotspots in Pennsylvania. Im starting to feel way way less optimistic than I did previously.",

Meanwhile we are sending billionaires up into space and have every facility and resource to make and issue protective gear - why are we not doing this?",

I'm still not dining indoors but meet up with friends to go outdoor dining, go to parks unmasked, groceries, etc. With the latest information coming out about delta, I'm worried about an upcoming work meeting in September. It'll be two days, indoors and it'll be about ten coworkers flying from all over the country (we have office locations throughout the us). I will also be flying to get to the meeting. I felt fine about not wearing a mask for the meeting but now I feel a bit worried, but should I be? Everyone will be vaccinated which is what was giving me peace of mind before all this news about the delta variant came out, but now I feel unsure again. I know that delta is spreading and is more contagious but I'm more concerned about whether the vaccine will be less effective come September since I got mine around March. Just looking for a reality check to see if I'm overthinking or if I am right to feel a bit uneasy.",

I understand that completely, but personally, Id rather be vaccinated especially with the lack of masks in our area. I dont want to push the subject too much as I know getting vaccinated is a personal decision, but I still dont sleep well at night knowing hes going to work unmasked, unvaccinated, and interacting with people. Maybe I just need to accept the fact he doesnt want to get the vaccine and find ways to combat my anxiety surrounding his vaccination - but Id still like to know if anyone has suggestions on how to talk to loved ones who arent vaccinated about getting the vaccine without being pushy or overbearing.

I cant even go outside because of my high levels of anxiety and paranoia. Because of this I lost all my friends and Ill probably lost my boyfriend. And the worst of it, is that my anxiety and paranoia are completely justified and with the new delta variant news I just dont have any hope anymore.

Last year we were waiting for vaccines so those who didn't want to take any chances with this virus could get vaccinated. However now so many people clearly don't want the vaccines and everybody who wanted one already got one. My understanding is that pretty much every expert agrees that this virus will become endemic. I expect that everyone will get this but the vaccines will protect us from getting severe symptoms. I feel like everyone is really scared of getting this virus even if vaccines protect us from getting severe symptoms. What are we waiting for now? Last year we distanced and wore masks waiting for this vaccine that is suddenly not enough anymore. Now there is nothing else coming. Are we waiting for a third booster? But by the time we get it we'll already need a fourth one. Do we need to do this \"just a bit more\" until we get the fourth one and then the fifth one and so on? Breakthrough cases are happening already. What can we do about that? Get a booster every month? Vaccines are giving us the best chances of only getting mild symptoms but that is still not enough because we might spread this disease and create variants. What is the end goal? I can't see how this will ever end. I feel like everyone forgot how in January we were sure by spring everything will be back to normal. Now we say early 2022. What about early 2022? What will we say then? I think there is no end to this because there will never be a time where covid will go away. This thing infects animals too. How can we ever get rid of it? I felt like we were going in the right direction. We have amazing vaccines that protect us but that is not enough anymore. What is? Please help me understand because I can't see what needs to happen to allow us to go back to normal.",

My whole life before Covid revolved around live music, both playing it and setting up for live events to earn a living. I genuinely don't think it's ever coming back. During May and June I stupidly let myself feel optimism that this would be over soon. I won't make that mistake again. Wasn't it Nietzsche who said that there's no true despair without hope? Whatever. Who fucking cares who said it. I was 28 when this pandemic started and turn 30 in December. That's two years of my life, the last bit of the prime of my youth, stuck inside. I know it's only been a year and a half since it got really bad but let's be honest here, the rest of 2021 is a wash because of Delta, and U.K. scientists just said pretty much definitively that it's only a matter of time before a completely vaccine resistant strain pops up. Looks like it's 2020 forever and ever! Two years of my life, my professional career, my creative outlet, an unfathomable amount of income, my savings, my mental and physical health, are all gone. All I feel anymore is the most extreme degree of anger that a human being is capable of feeling. Every day I read the news and feel like I'm being gaslit. I've given up. I want to believe that it will end, but I just can't. Two months of near normalcy and then it's like it's March 10th, 2020 all over again.",

My arm hurts so much more than I thought it would, but other than that, I can't say anything of note has happened. I'm grateful for that. That said... All this news about the delta variant and vaccine resistant strains being a possibility is really beginning to scare and upset me. I'm having a really hard time keeping my cool. I do truly believe this can't go on forever, and I'm willing to force myself to get through the emotional toll of lockdowns and mask mandates... but I'm so scared of losing my life to a vaccine resistant strain. It's hard not to be furious at the antivaxxers all the time. Someone in my extended family is going to die very soon as a result of catching the delta variant as an unvaccinated person. They are already brain dead, but still on life support as of last night. Their spouse also has it, and is refusing to go to the hospital despite probably needing to be put on oxygen. It's so terrible. All of this is so terrible. I'm really scared of dying from a new strain. I know they're talking boosters, but what if it's not enough?

Id wear one the rest of my life if I had to. Doesnt bother me at all. But lockdown is where I would have an issue. This past lockdown, I was in a depressive episode going into it. I was spending all my time in bed anyway, so lockdown didnt affect me much at the time. But now im finally in a much better place. Im getting very effective treatment for the first time in my life. I want to be out in the world interacting with people and experiencing life. Im so afraid of the possibility of returning to lockdown. Im so afraid it will push my mental health journey completely backwards. I know worrying doesnt solve anything. Im doing everything in my power. Im vaccinated and have still worn a mask this whole time. But I just needed to get it off my chest.",

Personally, I do not want to send my 10yo back until he is able to get the vaccine. However, I dont know any other parents who feel the same way. Most are EAGER to send their kids back to school. Right now, my state (NJ) is not allowing a virtual option. If I feel it is in his best interest, I will homeschool for the fall and re-enroll him when hes fully vaccinated. But with higher vaccination rates in NJ, precautions in school like masks and desk shields, etc., am I overreacting and putting my kid at a social disadvantage to his peers for what is a relatively low risk of infection? Saying that sounds crazy to me, though, considering the disadvantage he would be at if he did contract the virus and suffered long-term effects or death, God forbid.

For context, I am in my early 20s, have no underlying conditions, and have natural immunity against COVID. I was living in an epicenter when covid hit and my entire family got sick. That being said, we all had mild symptoms and none of us were hospitalized. None of us have underlying conditions and we all live very healthy lifestyles. Because I've had covid already and I'm incredibly low risk for ever being hospitalized (I literally have antibodies and have had the disease already, which thankfully did not land me or my loved ones in the hospital), I really do not understand why I need to get the vaccine. I understand that I can have renewed, stronger protection as I had it a while ago and the antibodies induced by vaccines can generate a stronger immune response than natural antibodies, but I am just not really afraid of getting covid. If it were a matter of lowering transmission, that's a moot point because it has been shown that people with breakthrough infections have viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated. As such, the only reason to get the vaccine is to protect yourself from hospitalization and/or death. I am not anti-vaxx and I think high risk individuals definitely should get the vaccine. However, I don't understand why I should risk potential side effects (even if they're rare) at this time. I do think we should do more to get high risk individuals in other countries vaccinated as well - I should not be a priority at all. If someone could explain to my why I'm wrong / misguided, I would really appreciate it.",

I do have very bad anxiety, especially around health, so it's possible it's that, but I normally only have palpitations once or twice a year despite my anxiety and despite drinking caffeine every day (I haven't had any caffeine since getting the shot). I haven't had any palpitations for a few days now and noticed that when I wasn't focusing on my heart or reading about the vaccine, I didn't have anything wrong, which makes me think maybe it's my health anxiety. But when I look at the covidvaccinated reddit and read about people having long-term horrible effects from the vaccine, or people suddenly dying, it scares me again. I messaged my doctor and she still recommended getting the second shot. I'm just scared because I know the second shot is supposed to be worse. I'm supposed to get it on the 8th and got a text today about scheduling it, and I'm just paranoid and don't know what to do. I feel like I can't really talk to my family about it because they were wildly against me getting it in the first place and keep trying to talk me out of the second one, but I can't afford a bunch of doctor's visits on my own. It took a lot of hyping myself up to get the first one because I was scared, but I feel even more scared now. I'm not trying to get health advice, I'm just looking for info and reassurance because I feel kind of alone right now.",

I have been putting off the vaccine for some time now because I work from home and spend most of time here, or, in open areas where I feel the risk is low. However, recently, I have been seeing more stories of young individuals being hospitalized and wishing they received the vaccine. This is when my mind changed. I don't want to be a news article. I want to be here for my family. I understand many of you out there may be nervous about pursuing the vaccine, but you should know that it will protect you. This is not to say that there is still no risk. I fully intend to continue taking care of myself and making smart choices, however, the lingering doom will no longer be weighing on me. The posts I have read here have given me peace and have helped me relax. Looking forward to continuing as a vaccinated person. Thanks Reddit! :D",

The cases in my country were 10 per day (small country with ~1.5 mil people) and those who came abroad had a PCR test. So I was around them outside with no mask. On the 10th I got my first <ORG> shot and on the 11th one of the guys at the workshop was sick. He stayed despite being sick and we were around 23 people, maskless, in a very small theater. I was the only one wearing a mask. On the 12th, guy is even more sick but still breathes and talks around us. Again, everyone but me is maskless. On the 13th he doesn't show up and in the evening we learned that he tested positive for COVID. So you know how this went - NO ONE got infected. No one sitting for 3-4 hours indoors, maskless with him, eating maskless with him, talking next to him, no one in the building got it. 20 people from us were unvaxxed/vaxxed with 1 dose, one was fully vaxxed and two had it. I worked on the movie Festival right after that in the same building and no one anywhere got it. We all got two mandatory tests, both negative for everyone except him. Even the two guys that shared a hotel room with him were negative. And no one even got sick, no one had as little as a headache. I don't understand. I still disinfect groceries. I still wear a mask even outdoors. I lost a dear person to this evil virus. I read people being careful and getting it. And yet 20 people in a room with a symptomatic person resulted in 0 infections. It is driving me crazy. Could it be a false positive from a regular cold? Nothing else makes sense.",

I feel like no matter where I look, where it be on the CDC website, WHO, newspapers, TV, from coworkers/friends/family, everyone seems to have a different idea of whats going on. Like is the vaccine not working?? Or maybe just not as effective against Delta? If I get the Delta variant, even as a fully vaccinated individual, is it not going to help? I know these questions might sound stupid but Im getting extremely contradicting answers. I was just starting to feel a bit more comfortable being out again. Like I got a new job, I still wear a mask when indoors or around people I dont know but I was really starting to feel like I could see loved ones again or go to the store without being nervous. The idea of having to go back to square one upsets me.",

This will be the first time I will be leaving my bubble and potentially being around people of unknown vaccine status. I am taking precautions and will have a variety of masks and mask straps to save my ears. I plan to be masked most of the time unless I'm eating, drinking, showering, etc. When I return, when would be the optimal time to get tested? I plan to re-engage the bubble and quarantine before seeing loved ones with health issues. I know to get tested if I'm showing symptoms, but I'm also concerned about asymptomatic spread. Short of getting alerted of exposure or exhibiting symptoms, when would be the best time to get tested after returning from my trip? Also, is the quarantine time still 10 days with the Delta variant going around? Thank you!",

I lost pretty much my entire mid 20s to this pandemic, and just when things were starting to get better, a new variant had to show up and it got to the point that even us vaccinated people are not 100% safe. During the time that it seemed safe, I planned a surprise dinner for my sisters 23rd birthday, but now Im wondering if I should cancel (cuz the reservations are for indoors, and at this point itll be hard to find anything else). SoI wonder it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are popping) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated? Im young as well (in my mid 20s) and everyone is also around the 23-26 range. All the people I live with are also vaccinated, and same with anyone who would be in our party (tho some of us are still with parents).

I'm so tired, I'm tired of the news, I'm tired of hearing about COVID, I'm tired of being told to worry, I'm tired being told I am a bad/selfish person because I simply just do not care about the case numbers and the deaths. We were told 2 weeks, and it turned into months. We were told vaccines would mark the beginning of the end, yet it just seems that the past is repeating itself. I hate it all. This coming fall semester I am taking a full set of classes. I am meant to go on site but looking at how we are reacting to these variants I doubt it will be anywhere close to a normal semester. If we go hybrid or remote, I will not succeed, I have ASD and I suffered and stressed through my classes in the spring semester to get decent grades, and I only had 3 courses. Not to mention the loss of social gatherings would just make me feel isolated and alone once again. As a psych major, I know that these strong reactions come from the trauma experienced going through lockdown the first time. But it feels like a cycle, it feels like nothing is enough. The vaccine wasn't enough, they said it was, but clearly now it isn't. So when and how does this end? I'm losing hope, and like others on this sub I feel that my youth is being taken from me. I feel cheated, and lied to, by my government, and by society as a whole.",

I feel so much pressure to travel this year, but I know that it's not a good idea to do. (At least in my opinion it's not). My grandparents also won't wear masks very well or social distance well if I visit them, and I don't want to spread COVID and give them COVID. My dad said that they are getting old and won't be alive forever, but what good does saying that do? If they got COVID, they could die. With the Delta variant and it being more contagious, I really don't want to spread COVID and get anyone sick. Any advice welcome on how I could go about telling my parents that I feel uncomfortable traveling this year?",

Saw that Delta Plus was trending and saw an article (which I couldnt read because it was behind a damn paywall) mentioning how South Korea (if memory serves me right?) found two cases of a so called Delta Plus variant even MORE transmissible than the regular Delta one. Needless to say Im spiralling. I was already having a very rough week in regards to the regular old Delta variant and was doing ok in terms of trying to avoid news and then this happens. I was feeling so hopeful after my second dose of vaccine and felt this almost euphoric wave rush over me knowing Im protected and now theres all this doubt with the variants and Im worrying that the vaccines wont help (which Im pretty sure is bullshit and anxiety talking but I keep doubting myself lol). I even finally got a job and have my first shift this Saturday which I only felt comfortable doing because things where I am SEEMED to be getting better (Canada, Ontario) and now not only am I shitting myself for my first shift Im also scared of being indoors on a busy traffic day with all these new people. I guess Im looking for reassurance and some hope. Its almost like I feel like I cant be excited for my new job or how other things in my life have been looking up because Covid risks taking it all away. Im trying very hard to stay positive but when I avoid news or try to think positive my brain SCREAMS that I need to be researching any and everything about this new variant shit or Im in danger lol. It also doesnt help that, at least in my opinion or experience, that a lot of the news and rumours about these variants and their effectiveness is so damn confusing and contradicting what I thought already to be true. Im seeing new efficacy rates (regarding the vaccine) everywhere, and its really scaring me honestly. THERE ABSOLUTELY IS OBVIOUSLY A POINT TO GETTING VACCINATED, and that goes without saying, but Id be lying if I said Im not thinking about how it FEELS worthless and like nothing matters seeing as new variants are showing up.",

What I want to know is do the vaccines still make the Lambda variant less deadly? There have been breakthrough infections with the Delta variant, but almost no one ends up in the hospital in those breakthrough infections. Am I wrong to think that so long as our vaccines just turn this virus into something more like the common cold or the flu, then thats a win?

I don't have direct contact with patients at my research job at a big pediatric hospital. My building isn't even near patient care centers. Why should I, a vaccinated person, be forced to mask up? My city is around 70% with at least one dose. My hospital has mandated vaccinated by October. What more do you need for normalcy? I can't stand this and it's making me fear for more restrictions come fall. I almost offed myself during the last lockdown. I can't survive another one. I don't want to hear \"Oh it won't happen. It would be unpopular.\" That's bullshit. The more people just shrug at mask mandates being imposed on vaccinated people and the emphasis on case numbers over deaths and hospitalizations, the more the government will think they can get away with more.

My siblings are also around as well as my nephews and nieces. However as I am on the train home I'm starting to deeply regret my decision. Yesterday we had a big argument because I suggested that we should do those quick self tests just to feel a little bit more safe. They are all vaccinated, but me being only 24 did not have the chance to get it yet (this is Portugal by the way, I know in the US for instance I could already get my vaccine). Anyway, they basically disagree said that they are safe now so they would not have any care, and go out and won't get tested. I've tried to reason explaining that I am still unvaccinated amd therefore at higher risk than them, and would be more comfortable of we still were a bit careful. I am not asking them to get tested every day, I plan to test myself very 4 days or so but would be fine if they did it once a week or so (doing what 2 tests in total while I am there). I'm feeling terrified, they say that I am being selfish for trying to impose some rules, but I am just trying to protect myself, I am absolutely terrified of getting Covid, and have been able to resist all this time and want to continue to do so. What do you advise me to do? What can I do to protect myself from my family? I plan to wear my mask in common spaces even though I know it annoys them, and maybe trying to prepare my food separately when they are not around. Being careful to wash my hands a lot and avoiding close contact with them as often as I can. Is there any crucial thing I should do too or am I forgetting something? Please help me, I am freaking out.",

Experts constantly warn of super spreading events and we should all wear a mask still. If the vaccine doesn't allow us to resume normal life what does? Why can't we just give up at this point and learn to live with it? I feel as if the experts had their way certain things would be permanently banned. I have a trip planned next month to Orlando and my parents think i should cancel it because I could be a carrier even though I got the vaccine after that which furthers my belief this will never end and this is just how things will be from now on. A day will never come when I don't have to hear about Covid or the vaccine on the news and certain events will just disappear out of fear of one virus. I don't know what to think anymore and truly feel like this is just life now. Masks and constant cancelations. If im being irrational sorry but I had to get this out there.",

Looking for support or advice So over the past year/2years I've had gnarly allergies and developed chronic nasal congestion, reguring sore/swollen throat, and occasional shortness of breath. Ontop of that I have chronic faituge and since I was a kid Ive had IBS symptoms so occasionally have diarrhea. I feel like every single month I have *some* combination of these symptoms, usually lasting 1-2 weeks per cycle. And am exhausted from all the paranoia around, is it covid?? Do I need to get tested and isolate?? Am I infecting people arlund me?? Do i need to disclose *all* of my symptoms to everyone I meet?? It feels like my body is just falling apart constantly, qnd every time I get tested for covid it comes out negative. (Got tested maybe 7/8 times over the past year. Feels like my body is becoming the Boy Who CrIed Wolf, and then one day if it actuslly is covid, I'm scared Im writing it off as part of the chronic/reccuring ailment. Feels like Im wasting so much time and energy on this when a cycle starts back up. Not sure how to navigate this, and its exhausted being anxious all the time, both being afraid of putting friends at risk, and also not wanting to let me anxiety gdt in the way of social/life activities. I question if I have hypochondria, and at the same time, I do have legitimate symptoms. UGH TLDR: i have chronic allergies, congestion, reccuring throat infections, shortness of breath, diahrrea, chronic fatigue, and I'm living in this state of paranoia/exhaustion every time these things flare up (~1/month). Struggling to know how to navigate this + the right things to do ethically.",

        "Reddit Post": "Hi Everyone! I'm having a hard time making a decision and was hoping for some more objective input. The short version is that my partner and I are both fully vaxxed but also both \"high risk\". Before Delta showed up in the US we booked a trip to a Florida beach with our also vaxxed but not high risk friends. At the time I had no concerns about the trip at all. But now I'm looking at the news in Florida and am starting to have concerns about the trip. We'd be going a few weeks after schools opened and it looks like hospitals are already filling. My partner works (fully masked) with the public, so I know we could already catch Delta at any time, but I am worried about catching it a 14 hour drive from home and in a place with very limited medical support. We also have very limited funds and really couldn't afford to extend our stay in the case that we got too sick to make the drive back up. We also really can't afford to have my partner take a week off from work and then take off another 10 days if we ended up exposed. I don't want to disappoint my friends though who already asked weeks ago to promise that we would go on the trip no matter what happened with Delta. I know that isn't a good reason to do something, but I am wondering if I'm being overly cautious and ruining a trip for three people unnecessarily. I know breakthroughs are relatively rare, but I already know half a dozen people at work who had them and their symptoms were way more in line with \"flu\" than \"sniffles\". Again, I know that we still need to live our lives and the vaccines are extremely protective, but since we are high risk, low funds, and would be so far from home, I'm worried about what would happen if we were to get sick down there. Does anyone have any input on if this is relatively safe or a bad idea? The beach itself is more residential and fairly remote from what I can tell. Thank you!",

From Apr 2020 to March 2021 I kept her off the ice, I was worried about covid. She plays ice hockey, and she's not a casual player, pre-covd she was skating 6 out of 7 days a week. And she loved it, would get upset that 1 day we didn't go. She asked everyday when lessons would start again. Is it safe to let her play again this fall/winter? Signs up start in a week! So I need to make my decision and I am having so much anxiety about it. She will be wearing a mask at all times in the rink and I contacted the organization and they said unless the city changes the mandates, there will be no enforcing masks and no extra precautions. The ice rink was built last spring, and I heard it has great ventilation from other coaches, so I think that's a plus. I'm just worried about the other kids not wearing masks after being in school all day (But, our city has a mask mandate for in person schooling, masks must be worn in the building).",

Back in March/April I was pretty adamant that I will be getting the vaccine but now Im not so sure. Both of my parents(50 and early40s) are hesitant and want to wait to see if there are any side effects. My grandmother(mid60s), aunty and uncle (both late40s) have taken the vaccine and they are fine. My uncle said that he was tired for a day or two. I have friends who have taken the vaccine and they are fine. I am all for vaccines and understand the need for it. I dont want to catch COVID and suffer from long term effects, also I dont want to spread it to other people. However, it is difficult because we live in an age where misinformation and opinions are easily spread from TV, newspapers, social media, friends and family. I have seen stories of people having adverse effects to the Vaccine, some people have had blood clots, people dying, other health problems. I want to get the vaccine but I afraid of the side effects. Will there be long term effects from the vaccine? Can anyone offer any words of support?",

I have friends, doctors, acquaintances all tell me that this argument is a silly stance to take. I know there are lots of people who don't want the vaccine for many reasons, but is this persons argument of minimal long term data on how it might affect someone in later life even valid? I said to this person I feel uncomfortable that they are \"anti-vax\" and they were offended and went onto suggests they weren't anti-vax. I don't see it that way but maybe I shouldn't have used that specific term? This person also suggests that there is data to show the \"viral load\" is the same in an unvaccinated vs vaccinated is the same or more and therefore it isn't going to help reduce the spread of the virus.

My husband got his 2nd <ORG> shot in February, mine in March and its been awesome feeling comfortable enough to doing things in public again but a few things have me on edge: Delta and any other, potentially worse variants that pop up, breakthrough cases, and waning vaccine efficacy. I know most reports say the vaccines are effective for at least six months, but what about after? The people who were in the trials have been well past six months so what about them? Will we need boosters soon? Im just really anxious to get data and the winter has me super nervous. We have a family reunion and wedding this month(with lots of unvaccinated) that Im already on edge about but after sitting inside for over a year and doing all the right things, I dont want to miss chances to feel normal. We bought concert and convention tickets for fall/winter and weve been trying to plan a vacation for years also but everything still feels so iffy. It sucks after having been so hopeful that this pandemic would have at least died down by now, I just feel stuck.",

But ever since then, chatter has gradually increased about this, and Jack has doubled down on his claims: [url] <PERSON>' latest show has now put a date on it: August 11. And if you search \"august 11 lockdown\" or \"biden lockdown\" on Twitter, an increasing amount of people are talking about it. Now I know that these are really not credible sources (I mean, <PERSON>? Come on...), but given how the Detla variant is tearin through the country and mask mandates are being brought back, I'm starting to get worried there might be some truth to this. Ever since Jack's first tweet, I've been obsessively searching for any and all signs of whether or not it's truly happening and it's turned me into an anxiety-ridden mess. Even though all evidence and logic point to it not happening (no restrictions beyond masks are being implemented anywhere, <PERSON> outright saying we don't need lockdowns anymore, vaccine rates are increasing, the DOW isn't nosediving like it did in early March 2020, the Rt is starting to decrease in many hard-hit states), the CDC's sudden switch on masks has set a precedent for a sudden switch on lockdowns happening too. What are you guys' thoughts on this? Should I (or rather, we) be worried about this? One of the main reasons I got vaccinated as soon as I could was so that I could return to a normal life. The fear of it potentially being snatched away again is eating me alive on a daily basis.",

Now Ive had ocd before this and ever since this started it got so terrible. Honestly bless my wife for putting up with me. I went the whole 9 yards with the disinfecting and not touching anything and If somebody including me would touch something or mess up the routine of coming home all hell would break loose with me. Part of the reason it got so bad was because we have a son who was 1 at the time and is now 2 1/2 and I dont ever want him to get this virus. So of course if i can do anything to prevent that I will. Fast forward now and i am completely different thankfully. Although I gotta say there are still quite some things that I wish I could let go. One of those is showering. I take a whole hr washing every body part for like 20 seconds multiple times. On top of that I constantly wash my hands repeatedly after touching a dirty part of my body that hasnt been cleaned yet. This also because I go to the gym so I psych myself out. I always end my showers with cleaning the inside of the shower including the handles as a just in case as well. Even when I come home I take my clothes off then proceed to spray alcohol where I took them off. I really wanna stop. I know transmission through touch is very rare but my OCD is getting to me still. Any tips or help?",

Is it worth the risk to work with the public when I don't absolutely need to? Or am I being too risk-averse?

Ever since Ive come home from university this spring, I have been constantly worried about them being unvaccinated. At the moment, they have their first doses of <ORG>. Throughout this whole thing this spring they were expressing a lot of doubt about information circulating around Covid. They mask when they go places, and they continue to practice social distancing. But I was worried they werent going to get it because of fear that it hasnt been long enough to know side effects. They felt unable to get the vaccine earlier this summer because we have been caring for my grandma in our house and would be unable to take care of her if they had bad reactions to the vaccine. My sister and I have been vaccinated since early spring. I live with them at home during the summer, and even though they have had at least one dose, they have really been pushing my anxiety as of late. They booked a vacation in another state in an area where cases are very high. No one is masking. Ive been in a panic all week. They know I feel really uncomfortable being here, and told me they were going to be safe and wear masks and social distance. All week they have been forgetting to wear masks indoors and converse with people who arent masked. If this hasnt made me anxious enough, today my mom came home with a headache and my first thought was panic because of the delta variant. I cant afford to get sick because I have school and work in a week. Plus my birthday is coming up and my boyfriend is going to stay with us, so Im freaking out right now that they might get sick. How do I stop being so anxious about this?",

She's a nice lady but she brushes off whatever I say when I try to explain the vaccine to her. I'm not great with words or debating topics either, so whenever I try I feel like I get lost on what I'm trying to say. She's of the mind that the doctors and scientists who are experts on the subject are actually lying, and believes that whatever loon she finds on the internet is a *real* expert just because they say so, and that the government is trying to keep them from telling the truth. She's convinced that everyone who got the shot will end up autistic within a year. (Yet somehow she didn't mind taking me to the vaccination site when I got it?) I'm 24, I've had issues with anxiety and depression since my early teens that have kept me behind where I should be in life, so I'm still completely reliant on my parents. I love my mom, but I'm starting to feel resentment toward her and its scaring me. Honestly, the vaccine thing is just one issue that's part of deeper issues I'm having with her. They're related, But they're not all about covid and the vaccines so I wont bring them up here. It got to the point today that I ended up in tears over the thought of living with her. I feel like her views on vaccines and the other things could make it unsafe for me both physically and emotionally. I could live with my dad, but he's going to be living about an hour away in a smaller town. I wanted to live with my mom because it's still in the city and closer to my friends, who are already an hour away in the other direction. I feel stuck and I'm having trouble seeing things working out. If anyone has any support or advice to offer, I'd appreciate it. I really need it right now,",

        "Reddit Post": "Ever since the beginning of COVID, Ive been really anxious about catching it. It first started because I didnt want to risk passing anything to my higher risk parents, but it also had to do with seeing friends lose family members to the virus. My parents ended up getting it (not surprised, considering they didnt take precautions all that seriously). Thankfully it wasnt serious - pretty bad symptoms, but nothing requiring hospitalization. Everyone has since been vaccinated and now seems to not care as much. Theyre comfortable dining outdoors, seeing friends, and forget to wash their hands for the full 20 seconds after coming home sometimes. Meanwhile, Im not comfortable with any of that, and I still wash my hands religiously, wipe down high touch surfaces, etc. Ive moved out during the pandemic, which has helped me since I honestly do not feel safe at home (COVID-wise). My family sometimes makes me feel bad because if we ever do get together for dinner, we cant eat outdoors because of me. Or Ill ask that they limit seeing others in the week prior to us getting together. Im supposed to be seeing my family for the first time in a few months tomorrow. I again asked them to not see people, which they agreed to. My mom saw a few friends, and my sister attended a wedding. I told my family I will no longer be going to dinner tomorrow. Part of it is COVID - yes, I dont want to go home especially after my sister went to a wedding. But a big part of it is the constant making me feel bad about my boundaries (which Ive clearly communicated) this entire time. Its the constant not respecting my boundaries, and its really frustrating. I guess this is me venting but also wondering if Im being dramatic and I should similarly stop caring so much now that I (and the rest of my family) are fully vaccinated.",

I was out and unable to do just about anything for a day and fortunately, it was on a weekend (the day after I got my 2nd dose), and after one day, my headache was much more manageable and wasn't as debilitating as the previous day. Personally (speaking for myself and maybe others as well), I would do it all again if it means to put the pandemic in the past and also to get continued immunity against Covid19 as well as the variants. I'll even take the booster shots and go through the suffering if it means that I can live a normal, pre-covid life again. Anyways, I hope this post (along others who gotten their vaccines) will help put some people's fears of the vaccines at ease. I am hoping for the pandemic to end sooner than later.",

I'm really struggling with my mental health and have started getting worse lately. I am fully vaccinated but I have a few health issues that will be life long and the idea of potentially having another scares the hell out of me. I have young kids that aren't vaccine age yet and school is about to start (they haven't voted on the mask issue). I was so happy when I got vaccinated and we still had mask mandates indoors. I felt pretty safe and relieved. Now that the mask mandate has been replaced with a suggestion, I never see them where I live. The area is only 45% vaccinated yet I am the only masked person everywhere I go. I'm supposed to close on a new house soon and the closing attorney's office won't wear masks. I don't even want to walk into the office. I'm mentally exhausted from the anxiety. I find myself avoiding everyone and not wanting to be around my family when they have gone to the market (masked of course). I spend an inordinate amount of time showering and just living in general panic. If I could spend the day in 1 room of my house I would. It's not a healthy place to be. Sorry to rant a bit here, I'm having a tough time. My health has been the prevalent issue in my life for the last decade as it declines and I'm terrified of what might happen next.",

Traveling different cities I've never been to, working out to finally gain some muscles, And visiting various countries... That was until the early 2020 hit me. Daegu and every other cities have turned into one of the most dangerous places to go, the gym i was about to go has closed, and international travels have stopped. I was shocked, but I eventually have gotten it over since I could just postpone the enlistment at that time, to make sure that I could do it in 2021. But as the recent worldwide delta variant caused all of the countries that were finally lifting the quarantine - even the ones that have pretty much achieved \"the herd immunity\" vaccination rates to bounce all the way back to mid 2020, I am slowly becoming doubtful if I could ever be able to do as what I planned a couple of years ago. If I delay my enlistment again, my college studying plan will be ruined and will have terrible disadvantages over my friends who already have gone to the Korean army and probably will return earlier than me. And even if I enlist myself and serve in 2022 as I am planning right now, I won't have much time to do all the things I wanted, as I am aiming to become a professor and probably will be busy for most of my life after I return.

Nobody cares to get it. I have patients with no masks most of the time and most arent vaccinated either. It makes me so anxious and I hate it. They literally breathe on top of me.

At this point, I am finding the restrictions that are in a lot of places not sustainable and that governments will have to back down on their vaccine passports to do non-essential things or taking a PCR test to enter a country. I understand the need for a vaccine passport (it should just be your vaccine card not something on your phone) to enter a country, but I am starting to feel uneasy with a number of the restrictions at this point and at some point we do have to just live with Covid and not put in restrictions for a region or city for a period of time. It feels very discouraging that as a fully vaccinated individual that I cant feel as though I cant go about my life as I did 2 years ago at times. Im still afraid of going to a church service, but yet two years ago I didnt hesitate in going. I just want to put this behind me",

So to fix this, I will wash my hands, wash my clothes and sanitize my personal items. This is just a vicious circle that is ruining my life, I've got to stop it. I really am doing it obsessively. Here are some examples: \\- Washing my hands after using the self-service machine in a supermarket \\- Washing my hands after touching a door handle \\- Sanitising my phone after touching a public door handle &amp; then touching my phone \\- Sanitising my bag or other personal items after someone else touching it \\- Sanitising my car after touching various public items (door handles, restaurant tables etc.)&amp; then touching my car How realistic actually is it from getting coronavirus from these things if I didn't wash and sanitize?

For one, the majority of classes at my school are being held full remote in the fall, though this is something Ive known about for months. Today, however, I just found out that my local anime convention, AnimeNYC, will not only be requiring the vaccine for all attendees, but they will also be requiring all attendees to wear a mask. I was already frustrated at de Blasio for trying to segregate NYC with the vaccine, but Ive become even more frustrated now that AnimeNYC has chosen to give in. I myself am already fully-vaxxed, but I think it is insane that they are requiring masks on top of it. If vaccines werent mandatory, I could understand requiring masks, but they are now being required at a vax-only event. I absolutely hate not being able to see faces in public, and Id hate it even more at the event I look forward to the most. Not only that, but other cons are implementing mask policies that dont allow costumes to have masks that cover the acceptable face coverings, making it impossible to cosplay certain characters. I thought for sure that the end of the year would give us total normalcy, but based on my classes being remote for the third semester in a row, and conventions introducing restrictions that change cosplay for the worse, I fear that the Delta variant is going to make the rest of this year a total shit show.",

Then the last couple of weeks hit, and honestly I'm just fucking frustrated. My brother is being a dumb fucking moron and wont get the shot, which is frustrating in an of itself. I have to hear my mom talk non stop about covid all the time, thankfully she's gotten her shots and is not antivax but I am at the point where I cannot deal with it anymore. I dont feel like things are going to get better, I'm just frustrated as fuck. When did we get to the point of this? why are there so many stupid people. My friends like \"well I dont want to travel in September if it's going to be bad still!\" Every video on my FYP for tik tok is a covid video, like complaining about anti vaxxers, or on how floridas hospitals are full. I dont know what to do, like Covid's already put a dent in these last two years, and I'm just frustrated that my life is in this constant standstill of not doing anything. Like I want to escape to a covid free bubble and I cant :( anyone got any advice",

I'm interested to know the true stats of things like what percentage of vaccinated people are actually getting sick, what percentage of vaccinated people have been hospitalized or even died, and of those severe cases, are there any kind of trends (i.e. they were older, had underlying conditions, hadn't completed the full vaccine series yet, etc.)? I know vaccines don't make you 100% immune from the disease, but I thought initial studies had shown that the mRNA vaccines were extremely effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death (I almost want to say that initial studies suggested 100% protection from serious cases, but I could be remembering incorrectly). I have been vaccinated for quite some time, but I still do very little other than hanging out with my vaccinated friends at home. If I could gain a better understanding of the true risks, I feel like it could help put my mind at ease a bit. Thank you all!",

Basically we have to wear a mask all day, anytime we are outside of our rooms. That means in class, outside, training, even just hanging out. We even have to mask up for sports practice and games. It usually comes out to basically wearing a mask from 6:30 in the morning to 10 at night with quick breaks for meals. Marching in 100degree weather while wearing a mask is awful. It pretty much instantly gets stuck to my face with sweat and i have to peel it off. And our faculty and Student Commanders are very strict...they see us talking with lowered masks we get chewed out. Even outside. And in the game room, we can loose privileges if our mask is down too long to take a drink. It's so depressing to just be hanging out, playing games, but fully masked. We can only snack in our rooms or distanced in the mess hall (even there we have to mask up as soon as we finish). And we have extremely strict dining rules...while eating, we can only talk when we are finished and have masked up again. idk I know it's important, and I know they take it seriously, but it such a bummer.",

I am now fully vaccinated with Biontech (I got my second shot on 24.07) and I want to hang out with friends again. My BF's cousin invited me to drink at his house. In total there would be four people (me, my bf, his cousin and his girlfriend). Everyone is fully vaccinated. Up until now, I have only stood in front of people with my FFP2 mask. I try to be less worried but I don't really have the guts to take it off unless I'm outside and no one's in sight.. I've met my BF a couple of times outside after I got my second shot but we both kept our masks on at all times. So, I really want to ask if it is safe to see people without masks when everyone is fully vaccinated. I am 23F and I have asthma and rheumatoid Arthritis. The one person who worries me in my family is my mom. She has diabetes, hypertension, hashimoto's, liver disease etc. She is in her early 50s. She is fully vaccinated with <ORG>. (Everyone else is my family is vaccinated too btw) I live with her, so if I do catch COVID despite being vaccinated, I am afraid I would pass it onto her. Alternatively, I also thought about isolating myself for some time after my hangout. I would be fine wearing a mask around my family for 1-2 weeks. I get tested regularly anyways (once a week) so there's that, too. Sorry if this seems paranoid, I just wanna be on the safe side. But I also get so depressed not having seen anyone for so long.",

Im in a very blue area and masks have come back in a nearby town and the university I attend is requiring both masks and vaccines this fall, due to Delta. I feel like its only a matter of time until mask mandates are in my town again for everything and its really making me spiral. I got the vaccine and had no problem with it, but it feels like it doesnt even matter at this point. If an entire campus that is vaccinated, surrounded by a community with high vaccinations, isnt safe then what would ever be safe?! Im deeply worried that masks are just a permanent part of life now in public, at least in my area. Ive voiced my concerns with some people and I just get shot down with its just a piece of cloth, its no big deal, itll just be temporary, etc. Maybe Im crazy but masks are worst part of the pandemic for me. I wore them where required this whole time, but wearing them and even seeing them really negatively effects my mental health. I feel like Im trapped in a dystopian movie and cant escape. A constant reminder to be afraid, that this isnt safe. I just hate how these concerns are always just swept aside as being whining or whatever. I just dont see how masks wont become permanent given the current logic of the mandates (vaccinated people can still spread). Can someone just give me some copium that these mandates will be over quickly? Like if the Delta wave ends, can I take the mask off? As crazy as it sounds, the new mask mandates are scarier to me than the Delta wave itself, but I feel like Im the only one who is upset about it.",

Say you live in a major city, the vaccination rate of 18+ is 70%, and you go to a party thats vaccinated-only. Is that safe? How safe is that? The worst of the speculation in the articles below comes with the prospect of hospitalization, or even long-covid, as the result of a breakthrough infection. Do I carry on as I was, assuming that Ill be safe when Im in vaccinated-only situations? Or do I hunker down in place, and wait for the science to tell me when to move? [url] [url]",

I work remotely, and rarely go outside of my house besides the occasional grocery store trip or restaurant pick-up window. I've been on the fence about getting the vaccine, purely because I have massive health anxiety and I've been told a while back that there's a risk I have a heart issue (left-ventricular hypertrophy) as well as PVCs. I don't have any symptoms other than the occasional skipped heart beat, but reading through some of the cardiac side effects people have experienced and seeing stories of myocarditis/pericarditis has really made my anxious. However, I'm also terrified of catching COVID and dealing with potential side effects or long-term effects from that as well. My state and city are a current Delta hot-spot and I don't see it getting much better in the near future. Unfortunately, I moved earlier this year and finding a primary care doctor has been a nightmare. The fastest I can see one is the end of this month, but I don't know if I should wait that long. I feel this immense guilt on me every day that I didn't get vaccinated sooner, or try and see a doctor sooner, and I just would love any and all advice you all might have for me. Thanks!",

Most of the time food has a bland burned-ish type of smell. As for taste, it isnt there at all. I can tell the difference between salty and sweet food. I can also tell some food have a different pattern than others. For example beans have a very strong and \"yummy\" texture. But I cant taste them at all. I never lost my appetite though. I still eat like I normally would. The feeling that my favorite foods leave in my mouth I think is what make them still enjoyable. And also I have always been a \"eat to live\" and not \"live to eat\" type of person so that also helped.",

Im 21 and have already had COVID a few months ago. My whole family are vaccinated but I just really really am wary about it. Im not a conspiracy nut, Im a left wing socialist student who is usually on the \"left\" for many many issues. The two things about this vaccine that gets me is that there have been no long term trials and the censorship coming from the pharmaceuticals . Firstly, my anxiety about the long term trials comes from all the previous drugs that failed on mass as a result of improper testing (thalidomide for example). Secondly, I *really* dont like that the pharmaceutical companies that made the vaccines included no liability clauses in their contracts w/ the gov, and they have made BILLIONS- why would they want to admit the vaccine didnt work even if we saw hundreds of adverse reactions? I feel like there is no transparency and I just dont trust them to let us know if it does go wrong. Ive always been wary of big business and this is the first thing I thought when the vaccine was created last year and I just havent been able to think differently on this issue Thats literally all I think. I agree that we should all be vaccinated. I want to be vaccinated but these two doubts are stopping me. Have any of you overcome your fears? Does anyone have any info that will me less anxious? Ive tried to talk to my friends about it and they dismiss my concerns but I feel like Im not being difficult with my views here and are genuine, common sense concerns?

        "Reddit Post": "Hey all. Looking for some support or advice/just wanting to vent. My family has faired fairly well throughout this pandemic, navigating it with little difficulty. I'd worked from home since long before the world went remote and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 year old since her birth. We're very much homebodies, so the lockdowns and such weren't a huge departure from the life we'd been leading prior. That's all changed with the school year quickly approaching. We'd initially planned on sending our daughter to Pre-K last year but opted not to because of our concerns about the virus. With an October birthday she's going to be one of the older kids in class this year and she is severely overdue for the type of social interaction that school provides. Anyway, sending unvaccinated kids back to school with the more transmissible Delta Variant being prevalent seems like a recipe for disaster to me. However, I don't think my kid can afford to be isolated another year. We're in a city where Pre-K is provided through the public school system on a first come first serve basis, so, pulling her and reenrolling her later in the semester once vaccinations are available for children under 12 isn't an option. On the plus side, masks are required but its a full-day class, so the kids have to remove those for breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm just at a loss for what to do and it disgusts me that we're still in this situation. At this point, my daughter would be absolutely heartbroken if we pulled her out of school but I'd much rather her heartbroken than suffer any longterm effects (or severe effects) of COVID. I'm sure there are plenty of parents out here dealing with the same and I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

I am very pro-vaccine in every sense, but I think the misinformation being spread, and the side effects being put on blast from the Covid-19 vaccine are scaring me a bit. I've always had pretty substantial health anxiety; I actually had a bit of a breakdown in March of 2020 (quit my job and everything). I live in a very rural, Republican area, and everyone around me is constantly bashing the vaccine and spreading HUGE amounts of scary and sometimes false information. I have not been vaccinated for Covid-19, but I'm very much on the fence. I'd say a solid 60% want to get the vax and 40% of me is terrified of it. On one hand, I'm scared to get vaccinated, but on the other, I'm absolutely petrified of getting Covid. I'm so scared of the rare but possible side effects of the vaccine, but of course, I'm more scared of the long-term side effects of actually contracting Covid-19. I've heard all sorts of side effects from the vaccine, like myocarditis and pericarditis, blood clots, heavier menstruation, and it all just really scares me. I think what I'm searching for in particular are words of wisdom from all walks of life. Whether you got vaccinated right away with no second thought, whether you were on the fence like me, or even if you were 100% against it and got it anyway. I'd also love to hear your side effects from the vaccine, and how you're feeling now. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and offers any positivity whatsoever. Thanks, you guys.",

A recent study out of the University of Maryland presents the first evidence that full vaccination against COVID-19 actually SUPPRESSES emergent mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants therefore successfully debunking the myth that vaccines promote mutations. &gt; &gt;COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2 and full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant mutation frequency. Researchers here showed that countries with higher vaccination rates generated FEWER mutations, suggesting less of a chance for the virus to gain virulent mutations in high vaccinated countries. Researchers found vaccination coverage rate was inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 16 countries of 20 countries studied and discovered Delta variants evolved differently under the positive selection pressure in the United Kingdom and India. Conclusion? Vaccines SUPPRESS emergent mutations. They DONT promote them. &gt; &gt;You can find the study here: [[url]",

But this is just too much. How can you believe your own bullsh\\*t SO much? It makes me angry because these people are prolonging the pandemic. It makes me angry because friends of mine are suffering from long covid. It makes me angry because people have died from this horrible virus. I want it to be over. Everyone who has done their part to help bring an end to this pandemic wants this to be over. I'm also spiteful and I want to see these people be proven wrong. But I just can't do it anymore for my mental health. It takes too much out of me trying to fight it. My anxiety has spiked again these last few months and it makes me lose sleep. I know I have to protect myself first and try to let it go, but it's difficult. I try to limit social media (I can't fully as I run a business) as much as I can. I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere I'd be understood. If you have any tips on how to deal with this, I'd love to hear them. Please stay safe.",

There is also the aspect of dealing with people: I am less insecure now than I used to be before the pandemic, but Im afraid of the insecurities coming back.

You can imagine how much I miss them I started hearing news of some cons reopening with varying restrictions, (though I wish those restrictions were tighter) and had hope of a 2022 con season. In fact, my favorite con announced they're returning in January and I'm hoping to go. However, a con called megaplex just took place, and immediately after accounts of catching covid started pouring in, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated (because of delta). Conventions are infamous for spreading illness even before covid, so there's a real scare here. Now I'm seeing takes that absolutely zero conventions should take place in any capacity, and more specifically that it's better for them to go under than to think about reopening. As if it's easy for an organization low on money to just run a convention again. And it depresses the hell out of me. having a mask rule + proof of vaccination + limited capacity really shouldn't be hard...but the worst part is I know that at this point that might not even be enough. If with those two things, we STILL can't hold them at all, when the hell are we ever getting out of this? I'm so tired, I just wanted this little glimmer of something to look forward to, and now it's fading away more Its just super spreader event after super spreader event as things try to come back it feels like. And I'm scared of some of the things I liked to go to just collapsing from lack of funds and never coming back",

It huts even more because I feel like I've been vaxxed, I've done my part, why should I and others who did the right thing be punished with more lockdowns or social shaming that we should isolate? At this point I don't ever see myself having a wedding, and I find it pointless to plan a life beyond a week or so.",

Knowing how lockdown happy and reactionary Canadian governments can be in terrified for the fall being just like fall 2020. I cannot waste another year of life again. My fear is that the unvaccinated will drive a huge surge and the province will go full lockdown mode as a reactionary measure. If we have to lockdown again with so many people vaccinated then Ill have lost all hope for life and be completely defeated. If the vaccines cant stop this, then Ill have tapped out. I dont know how to stop my spiral thinking. Ive tried to avoid all news and case counts but its inescapable. Lockdowns again would mean losing my side projects in events and pretty much leave me defeated.",

My partner and I double masked and kept alcohol wipes in our backpacks. But our flight was basic &amp; pretty packed. I couldn't ignore some sneezy child and coughing passengers and always assume the worst; We made sure to wipe down our backpacks after getting off the plane &amp; wipe down the luggages. But how safe are planes with circulating the air? I've heard the horror stories of an entire flight catching the virus... Should we have worn gloves &amp; eye shields?? I'm now back in the office double masked, sitting in front of an AC on full blast, my throat feels dried, maybe I haven't drank enough water. My head aches a little..maybe it's because of the back-to-back meetings now that we're all back in the office for the first time since the pandemic. Sorry I'm internally going crazy of all these small \"what if\" just because of the flight coming back. These small things like a dried throat and mild headache only started when I returned working in the office 2 days after the return flight. Today feeling pretty normal other than mild dried throat.",

They are requiring a rapid test negative within 72 hours for all attendees, but I'm not sure if they're requiring vaccination. Masks are required, but because I'm in the coffee industry people will be demoing products and there will be tastings, especially in the workshops I'm teaching. Plus I'll have to take at least two legs of a flight to get there, so crowded airports are a risk, and this is an event that usually has an international audience, so there's the potential to introduce new variants. If people are getting rapid tests before they fly, what about if they pick something up during travel and spread it at the event? &amp;#x200B; I'm vaccinated, but I'm still really scared of catching COVID because I'm a sensory/flavor scientist and losing my sense of taste or smell could kill my career and make my PhD practically worthless for anything I'm interested in doing, and there haven't been enough break-through cases yet to know if permanent loss is a risk with mild vaccinated cases like it was for mild unvaccinated cases. &amp;#x200B; But I'm also on the job market, my current contract ends in January so this was going to be the perfect networking event for me. Furthermore, the organization running the expo funds my lab's research, so backing out is not an option unless they cancel the conference entirely - it would hurt both my own career and the relationship my lab has with the organization. &amp;#x200B; I'm so frustrated by this Delta variant uncertainty. I don't know how much my worry is justified. An acquaintance of mine just hosted a party, all vaccinated, and a few days later 1/3 of the attendees tested positive.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated: We are currently a household of 2 vaccinated adults, 1 unvaccinated adult, and 5 children ages 3-11. Its a small house, so no isolating from one another was possible. On Friday July 30th my husband started having symptoms. My unvaccinated 7 year old niece also had some very mild symptoms. On Saturday July 31st my husband and I both got Covid tests. He came back positive, I came back negative. On Sunday August 1st, I started having some very mild symptoms and the unvaccinated adult (my sister in law) started having more significant symptoms. My 10 year old niece developed a cough that she still currently has, although its gotten better. On Tuesday August 3rd, the 5 year old mentioned that her throat felt funny. The 11 year old mentioned a mild headache and some stuffiness. The 3 year old never showed symptoms or reported anything because hes 3. On August 9th, the unvaccinated sister in law returned a negative covid test. However, on August 10th she visited a walk-in clinic and returned a positive covid test. None of the children have been tested. The sister in law still has a cough as does the 10 year old. When is safe for the adults to leave isolation? When is it safe for the children?",

About 20% of the lungs were infected (as per the CT scan at that time) and she recovered at home. The only ongoing problem was a bit of weakness, change in mental outlook and cough. ================================== Now in June 5 an X-Ray was done and the report said: Findings: * Scattered opacities are noted in the both lower zones. * Calcified shadow is seen in the right para tracheal region Impression: Suggestive of pulmonary inflammatory change. ==================================== We went to the Pulmonologist and he said its to be expected from COVID and its nothing serious. My question is: * Can this be a sign of pulmonary fibrosis or something similar like interstitial lung disease? * What are these opacities anyway? * Is this a sign of any permanent damage? Note: My mother had tuberculosis 35 years ago, so the calcified shadow could be due to that or something else as well. This is what the Pulmonologist said. Another important thing to note that in Bangladesh doctors don't tell you the truth. If you have a serious condition they are likely to downplay it and say \"oh its nothing\", so as not to stress the patient or their families. This is the culture. So this is why I am asking here.",

The fact that the FDA just approved booster shots for immunocompromised also makes me suspect that they knew something was up with <ORG>s efficacy, otherwise they wouldnt have made a decision so urgently.

I'm tired of getting replies like \"it will be over in the US soon\", or \"can you move to a different state where restrictions are less strict?\". I am not in the US, I am in Southeast Asia where things are really bad here, vaccination rates are low, and most restrictions have not been lifted. I know people are just trying to be helpful, but COVID is a completely different situation in other parts of the world, and it sucks even more to hear that other countries are getting back to normal when your own is still stuck in a mess with no end in sight. I just hope that people can be more conscious of the fact that there exists a whole world outside of America, and everyone's experiences with COVID is different. Maybe don't jump to conclusions that everyone on reddit is from a developed, Western nation with sufficient resources to deal with this virus? Remember that the WHO said this pandemic will not be over until it's over for the whole world. Even if things seem to be looking up in your country, if the virus is still spreading in other countries, it is just a matter of time before it circles back to the US again (just like Delta).",

Last weekend I hung out with a group of friends at a bar (this bar required proof of vaccine for entry) and my group of 6 were all in close proximity, indoors and sharing food. My friend (fully vaxxed) tested positive for covid a few days later after experiencing very mild symptoms so the rest of us went to get tested as well. We all tested negative with no symptoms! I honestly felt such a relief after this. Not just because I tested negative, but it just truly affirmed for me how well they work. Delta is scary, but had we all not been vaccinated this would have likely been so much worse. We live in a state where Covid hasnt been too bad, and honestly we had relaxed quite a bit, but this definitely was a bit of a reality check but also a major sense of relief at the same time. Get those shots, if you havent yet. Seriously.",

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I genuinely don't know the answer to this. I'm looking for some advice. As the title says, I'm 23 and do not really have any health issues. I ask this question humbly and am at this point looking for some reassurance that I am doing the right thing by agreeing to take the vaccine. I'm scheduled to take it in a few days, I don't know which one I'll be taking (here in my country for some reason they did not let me know which one I'll be given). I don't know what difference it makes which one I'll be taking. I have distanced myself from all the news and am not well informed at all about all the different types of vaccines. It's not a smart thing to do on my part but I've had a tough year and it was the last thing on my mind. I've heard some people say that at my age it's not worth it to take the vaccine because the benefits of not catching a virus that would likely not do much harm to me to begin with is overshadowed by any potential side effects that the vaccine could cause. Is this true? Am I just overthinking this? Could there be any long term side effects from any of these vaccines, or will it really most likely not impact my life in any way other than just maybe getting sick for a couple of days after taking the vaccine (which has happened to some people I know)? TL;DR: All I want to know is, am I doing the right thing by getting vaccinated at my age? Thank you in advance.",

I live in the mid-Atlantic and am visiting my mom in a large city in a Southern state, where Im from and my dad + his family also live. My mom and I are both vaccinated, but Im wondering if I should make a day trip to a more rural part on the state (right on the boundary of the suburbs of my city and the country, with ~300 new cases today) to visit my father and his family, what with Delta and everything especially because my mom has a new nerve disorder leaving her immunocompromised. Shes still in the process of recovery, which could take up to 2 years. Both I and my dad have been in a few states this past month (I just saw a friend for 2 days on the way down to come visit; he visited family in 2 diff states). How concerned should I be about delta here? Transmitting it to my mom, etc? Im a little worried about my dads reaction if I cancel; hes very anti-vaccine and we have avoided really talking about this so far, though I did see him earlier in the summer when delta wasnt so much of a threat. Could I link him something about delta and the immunocompromised to get out or it? Thanks in advance.",

I feel like Ive been mostly very lucky with how my family takes Covid seriously, but Im just at my emotional wits end trying to explain something that seems like it should be obvious. Theyre interpreting the numbers in a way that tries to make an incorrect point about how vaccines dont change your chance of surviving Covid once youve been admitted to the hospital. I feel like Im on crazy pills and dont know how to explain it to them in a way that doesnt make me want to pull my hair out. Theyre looking at the rates of hospitalization and deaths in each state, per 100,000, for fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. Theyre looking at data reported by the NYTimes which was updated 3 days ago. So for example, California, where we live, has reported 647 hospitalizations and 58 deaths for unvaccinated people, and 9 hospitalizations and 1 death for vaccinated people. Now, theyre calculating that 58/647= .089, and 1/9= .11, so you have a higher chance of dying in the hospital from Covid if youre vaccinated (instead of realizing that this data really means you are 58X more likely to die of Covid if youre unvaccinated in CA). Basically theyre saying the vaccine doesnt work to help people who are already hospitalized because you have a higher rate of dying in the hospital if youre vaccinated. This data may be *technically* correct, but its missing the context of the fact that the vaccine keeps people out of the hospital in the first place so one person out of nine dying skews the number outrageously. So what do you guys think, how do I explain to them that this interpretation of data is erroneous??",

Well guess what, that light turned out to be an oncoming train, just like I feared. Thanks to this fucking Delta variant, our progress against this fucking virus is getting wiped out, and I cant take another year of this. All this isolation, distancing, sacrificing, and whatnot was supposed to buy time to develop a vaccine. Instead, the goalposts keep moving. Vaccines were supposed to bail us out of this shit, not be an extra burden. If vaccines dont eliminate the need for masking/distancing/canceling events, why would Joe Blow Schmuckatelli take time out of his working schedule to get vaccinated? Never get my hopes up *ever again*. This sub has given me false hope only to punch me in the dick.

Saturday morning I'm about halfway through the four hour drive and she calls me to say her throat is kind of sore, she goes and gets a rapid test and the result is negative. I figure it's just a cold, I mean we're vaccinated after all. We spend the whole weekend together and her sore throat turns into a cough and full blown cold symptoms. She has two more tests through out the week (both rapid and pcr) and both come back negative. Fast forward to today, I feel a tickle in my throat and constant mucus drip coming down...as a precaution I text my boss and say I have to work from home today. My throat got worse throughout the day, and even though she tested negative three times now I figure I may as well get tested myself. I almost didn't know what to say when the doctor came back in and said \"well hey I'm sorry I really was hoping I'd have better news for you, but you have covid\". The next hour of my day was spent texting everyone I've stupidly been in contact with in the past week, coworkers, friends, family. I can't help but feel like if any of them come down with covid it is absolutely my fault, I went and visited someone I knew had some sort of bug and still did not quarantine because they tested negative, I've never felt so selfish in my life.

I'm hopeful that by the end of the Delta wave in the U.S., enough people will have been inoculated one way or another to prevent another widespread surge. My only concern is the potential emergence of a more vaccine-resistant variant, but I doubt there will be one that completely bypasses the vaccines, due to how the vaccines are formulated. But even so, a vaccine-resistant variant would not be completely foreign to our immune systems like the original strain, so we'd never be put back to square one, right?

Also did an antigen test at home which was also negative but Im still afraid I got the virus from my aunt since she possibly already had it when I was there. Im not sure if its to early for the virus to show up in my test result. What do you guys think? Should I trust my results or is it still to early to do a test?",

I don't necessarily watch the news, I don't like watching news, but every time I've heard bad news about Covid19 and becoming a pandemic, I started lose hope and my mental health got really bad. And I blame the news for that. News always fear monger and that makes people go crazy, sad, scared, and confused. Why, when I was working as a courtesy clerk at Vons, people argue for masks. There was theses two men arguing each other. One is wearing a mask and the other guy is not wearing a mask. The guy not wearing a mask says he believe in science and the other guy wearing mask tells him that he is a selfish a-hole. And the news always makes false information about the vaccines and it's no wonder nobody wants to or too scared to get vaccinated. I was nervous to get vaccinated, but I got vaccinated and it wasn't so bad. Why can't the news be hopeful, for once. Something must be done with the news to end this fear monger if we want to end this pandemic. Sure, the virus will sadly last forever, but they can't let this pandemic last forever. Stupid news!",

Countrywise, 75% of all adults have received at least one dose and this number is still growing, as the rollout is now focused on young adults (18-25) who werent eligible to get their jab before. While this might seem a vaccine success story, it did not come without its hurdles. Vaccine rollout has been dramatic, to say the least. Bolsonaro is an anti-vaccine apologist and has sabotaged vaccine purchases since they first came. Being the 2nd worst affected country in the world, with over 500k dead, didnt change his heart. In stark contrast to other national leaders on the world, he did not get his jab and does not plan to do so. Skepticism and politicization of vaccines soon struck. We are screwed, I thought. Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US. Young people werent likely to get their jab this year. But somehow, it happened. Despite being disdained by the federal government, vaccines were soon became a representation of hope, soon became something the people needed to fight for if we were to have any chance against this disease. Little by little, Brazilian social media feeds were flooded with pics and videos of people being vaccinated. They put on their best clothes, posting their photos with inspiring takes on the importance of vaccines on Instagram. There is even a joke running here this vaccine only works if you post about it on social media This kind of good and organic peer pressure paid off - upon seeing their friends and relatives getting their jab, most Bolsonaro supporters reluctantly jumped in line to get their jab, even those people would avoid being excluded by their families. Against all odds, we are making it. We dont have many fully vaccinated people yet (just 30% of adult population). Peer pressure and social media work wonders. Close people getting their shot and sharing their experiences work better than some celebrity endorsements and free ice cream.",

Had it for about a couple of weeks now. I went to the doctor and he suggested I get a covid test. Have one scheduled for tomorrow morning. I have to admit, quite nervous about it. Not only the result, but the test itself. My housemate spent Saturday at the ER for an unrelated issue and they gave her a covid test and hers was negative. She also told me that it hurt really bad and that she had tears in her eyes from it. She's really the only one I've seen or been close to though for more than 5 seconds. So I'm not sure if I do have it where I could have got it from. If it's not COVID, not sure what it is. Maybe just a bad sinus infection. My taste has been a little screwed up. Both me and my housemate have been vaccinated as well. So I hope if I do have it, that I don't get any sicker than this. At least it seems to have left my lungs alright so far.",

I am so afraid. I have been having constant nausea and stomach pain for the past month, and I tried to just ignore it but this morning it was excruciating. I folded and went to the ER (even the thought of it was terrifying to me, but the pain was so bad). I was there for about 2 hours, had blood work and a CT done, nothing serious found, was prescribed some medication and my stomach ailment should be better soon thats good, right? Yeah. My anxiety about that has evaporated, but now Im hyper focused on the possibility that I was exposed to COVID while I was there. Delta is going crazy, and they treat plenty of COVID patients at that hospital just thinking of how many covid positive individuals shared a chair with me in the waiting room or my recliner in the hospital room makes me shudder. Im utterly terrified. I came into close-ish contact with nine hospital employees in that two hours. No interaction lasted more than 15 minutes, most being shorter. Everyone was masked. Ive tried to search for others posts worried about a similar issue, but I havent really found much Im just so scared, guys. It hasnt even been eight hours since I left the hospital and Im already a nervous wreck. How will I possibly survive the next two weeks worrying :( I know I sound silly. Im sorry",

My family wore masks, so I felt like things were good. Right before the ceremony started, two other cousins showed up with their families. One has 7 kids, the other 5. They all just had coronavirus. Supposedly it went through all of them. It spread to the grandfather, who is now in the hospital with a ventilator. My cousin said it's been \"at least two weeks\" since they had symptoms, but I know for a fact that her mother, who lives across the street from her, is still battling coronavirus (they are a very close family). I found my kids playing with their kids and instructed them not to play since they had the virus go through their house. It's completely put me on edge and ruined the whole evening. We left early.

        "Reddit Post": "I live in western Washington and am vaccinated with <ORG>. My boss, the only doctor in the private healthcare office I work for (all vaccinated, as far as I am aware), tested positive yesterday after feeling ill on Thursday. I was in the office around him often for 8 hours on Wednesday and for two hours on Thursday before he went home, wearing masks the whole time. In addition, the other person working in the office on Wednesday is now feeling ill and is getting tested as well. I am having no symptoms and tested negative using a rapid result test on Sunday, but I know those can throw false negatives, so I got a PCR test today along with my roommates who I could've potentially exposed and am now waiting on the results from that. My boss says if I test negative I should be able to go in from Thursday on (even though the practice will be mostly non-functioning given he's obviously not going in for at least a week), but I don't trust his advice given he's been attending weddings and conferences this summer. Even if I do test negative, because I work in a healthcare setting (non-emergency, I don't want to give the exact profession but in a similar vein to a physical therapist's office) I feel I should quarantine for the full ten asymptomatic days to be certain I'm not going to experience delayed infection, and because I live with immunocompromised and at-risk individuals. Is this an unreasonable ask? He's making me feel unreasonable for being wary at the thought of going in before I've quarantined the full amount; we only have a handful of front desk staff and if even one of us gets sick the others have to pick up the slack. On a more personal note, is there any way y'all have found to deal with the intense guilt of potentially exposing people to Covid? I've been doing everything I can since March 2020 to avoid this exact scenario and it feels so endlessly frustrating that simply working to try to survive has landed me in this mess.",

We can take the VA data to reflect the effectiveness of the vaccine over all. * less than 2% of covid cases in VA are related to fully vaccinated individuals * out of all fully vaccinated individuals in VA, less than 1% have developed covid (and less than 0.01% were hospitalized due to covid) * graphs at the bottom of the dashboard really highlight the differences between the fully vaccinated population and everyone else Note: Some can't get vaccinated even if they want to (due to medical reasons, etc.) so it's important not to lump together everyone who hasn't gotten vaxxed.

Well, I just returned to my home state from my internship, and someone I know who was vaccinated and masked was just hospitalized for a week due to the Delta variant (she fortunately returned home yesterday, but I was really worried), and one of the people I wanted to see more than anyone has now had to cancel us getting to see each other indefinitely due to the same variant (we had finally started to make plans to see each other this week after having not seen each other for over 1.5 years before it was really known how bad the Delta variant would be). Im so over having any amount of hope anymore, since I know Ill just get my hopes up, and Im not even looking forward to going back to college this weekend since I feel like things will just be bad again with this variant for who knows how long (even as someone who is young, doesnt have pre-existing conditions, and is fully vaccinated).",

Why wouldnt I just get a booster every 12 months like the annual flu shot? 8 months seems kind of silly unless you are high risk, immunocompromised, or over the age of 60. Also, do we know if the 8 months starts at the date of your first vaccine (if you got the double dose MRNA vax) or is 8 months from when you are fully vaccinated (so 14th day after your second shot)? Also also, what about healthy people who had a breakthrough infection this summer? Why the hell would they be recommended to get a booster? I feel like a lot of people on the internet or politically left leaning family members would think Im anti vax for taking this stance. No. I think vaccines save lives.

These are only my feelings at the moment, but I feel like getting them out and having feedback from others would help my COVID recovery, at least mentally. Here it goes. I tested positive for COVID after pretty much my whole family got it. While I only tested positive in the last 16 hours, I have felt off since 8/12. Here is where I'll let you in on my dilemma, and I do not expect pretty much any of you to agree with me. There is a girl that I work with that I think is insanely pretty and cool. I have been gradually getting closer to her over the last few months and I feel like we're really starting to become friends. The problem is, her last day of work is on 8/20 before she goes back to school, and I would really like to stay in contact with her while she is at school. I was planning on asking for her snapchat on 8/20 which is the next and last time I will see her for some time. My COVID diagnosis threw me for a loop I did not expect and if I follow all guidelines I will not be able to see her by the time she leaves for school. This has led to me planning to hide my diagnosis in order to see her and talk to her before she goes away until December. Obviously this puts her and my other coworkers at risk of catching the virus, but I feel like I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't make an effort to talk to her. I know this is immature, and I know that this has an answer that is very obvious to most. I only ask for respectful feedback. Honestly, I'm not sure that I didn't write this up to sort of get my thoughts out in the open, but I really like this girl and want to pursue a relationship with her. Even if not a romantic relationship, I just think she is super cool. Thanks for reading and TIA to anyone with any feedback.",

I honestly don't know what I was thinking-- about an hour and a half in, the space got even more crowded and I finally got uncomfortable enough that I decided to leave. I'm ashamed and embarrassed and at a loss with myself. I promise I'm not looking for reassurance here; I know that I made an awful decision, and I want to handle it now as responsibly as possible to avoid infecting anyone in my community. I'm fortunate to be a grad student at a university where we have access to incredibly accurate rapid testing (results in 6-24 hours, generally), and I've decided to self-isolate until I get a negative test result. I canceled several in-person meetings this week, the most important of which being with my thesis advisor who has a 10 year old son. I told him what happened and that I thought we should postpone, and he suggested we met Friday morning, of course pending a negative test result. The new CDC guidelines say that you should get tested 3-5 days after exposure, so my question is, if I test Thursday morning (roughly 4 and 1/2 days after potential exposure) is that long enough to really trust a negative result, or should I wait, push back with my professor, and self-isolate for longer? Could I trust a Friday morning test? Saturday morning? Any advice would be deeply appreciated-- I really appreciate this community and this space.",

However, the part of the article that states this is actually from an article written a few weeks ago (before the \"final wave\" prediction was made), so was he referring to the case numbers we're seeing now (NY was bringing in about 4,000 cases per day during the past week, but the past two days have brought about 3,000; can't say for sure if it's peaked), or is the worst still yet to come?

Idk what to do because I fear another lockdown and missing out on stuff and I can't take it anymore. We're always slow to open up so even when things are relatively good we get less time to enjoy it than others and end up even further behind in my career. And I feel trapped because I don't have a full-time job, am still in school, and am very much under my parents thumb; we recently moved to an apartment so there's even less personal space now (25/F btw). Does anyone have any advice for me on what to do and how to handle things?",

I don't want to sound like a 10 year old in the backseat of his/her parent's car yelling: \"Are we there yet?\" but everything seems so far away and so apotheotic that I don't know anymore. Uncertainty has certainly been consuming more and more, it's been 1 year and a half that I haven't gone out to do ABSOLUTELY nothing, and when I go out, I get home and take a thousand showers before doing anything, the fear of losing my family is too much. Yesterday I took my first dose of the vaccine, and don't get me wrong, I would take another 300 doses if necessary, but after taking the vaccine, I was more nervous and anxious than before, which should have been a light at the end of the tunnel, it felt more like an accessory than a real weapon to combat this whole situation. Nothing else seems to make sense, I just wish my belief in a really normal future didn't become something as distant or as romantic as it seems to be in my head.",

That means we should only expect the rest of the year to be more and more and more and more case climbing and zero chances of flattening. Even with the vaccinations. I have gone between being hopeful and losing faith, and unfortunately, I'm falling into the latter again because of this. Fact: cases are NOT crashing even with vaccinations and there are only going to be even more and more and more and more and MORE increases week after week. There is no end coming to this Delta wave, it seems. Sadly, it doesn't look like it will peak either this week or September, nor even October, November, not any time this year. Expect each week to be nothing but more and more gains and zero declines. That's what I hear these people saying. I feel we'll never see the end of this, but I hope I'm wrong.",

However, I've yet to get vaccinated because my parents are extremely anti-vax, and I'm still on their health insurance. I've been terrified of going behind their backs since I know that it will show up if the pharmacy somehow links me to the insurance (like they're supposed to). So, I was wondering if anyone knew what exactly the pharmacies use to \"look up\" your insurance. If I say I don't have any, will they still check? Is it through my address, birthday, etc? My plan right now is to go to a pharmacy, say I don't have insurance, and provide my school housing address rather than my home address where my parent's insurance is registered. Is this enough? Or do I need to lie about my birthday as well... I know this probably raises some ethical questions, but I figure getting vaccinated outweighs those. It's been too long, and I need to get it done ASAP.",

In my country of residence, vaccination was very slow, but in my other country of citizenship, vaccines were widely available. I received my first vaccine dose in the country of residence, but the second dose was not to be available for another 3 months. During this period, a close family member in my other country of citizenship became very ill, and I needed to get there immediately. Additionally, in order to be able to see her, because of strict rules, I needed to be fully vaccinated. And so, I took my second vaccine there, and the physician accepted the proof of my first vaccine from my residence country. It was the best decision, because I was able to spend an entire month with my family member, and left feeling at least somewhat less heavy-hearted. The problems is that my residence country will *not* accept my vaccination record from the other country, and so I am officially \"not fully vaccinated.\" What this means is that I cannot be granted the current \"Vaccination Passport\" available to all residents, which allows those fully vaccinated to travel to all other EU countries without quarantine, testing, or other problems. Without this, traveling - which I need to do for my work - will become extremely difficult, often impossible. So I'm thinking of just going to get my \"second\" vaccine here in my country of residence, which is now available, and then the authorities will issue the passport so that I can get on with my life as much as possible. I have read quite a few things from what appear to be reasonable sources online, and it seems that getting a third vaccine within a period of three months wouldn't be harmful - but I obviously want to be very, very careful. Anyone have any solid information/advice one way or the other? Thanks in advance.",

Im quite nervous about this because I have some medical things going on right now, and although I am also vaccinated (<ORG>), I still worry my husband will bring it home and I will catch it. I was also planning on visiting some family this coming week, but I dont feel I should do this now in good conscience (my niece and nephew are too young to be vaccinated). Some background, he did not sit near the positive coworker (he said they were around 10 feet away from one another), but nobody was wearing a mask at the meeting because everyone in the meeting was vaccinated. The meeting was only about 20 minutes long. I do not know if any windows were open and/or how big or small the room was. The safety department chair said my husband doesnt need to quarantine because hes vaccinated, but I know weve been seeing a lot more breakthrough cases. Should I isolate from my husband, or is the risk in this situation fairly low? Should I officially cancel the trip to see my family? Side note, everyone in my family is also vaccinated with either moderna or <ORG> except for my niece and nephew, who are again too young to be vaccinated. Id be worried about giving it to them though. Help!",

I have been told all my life how spoiled and privileged I supposedly am when I grew up poor with 2 drug addict parents. Right now I am unemployed, I was formerlly a carer and now the government is refusing to pay me anything for a stupid reason. i have to contact a social worker to beg for pittance. I feel no loyalty to a country and society that has made it clear it hates me. What does this have to do with covid you may wonder? Well here young people can't even get a single vaccine. I can't even get AZ in my area, some can. But basically if you are under 30 there are no vaccines available still. They doubled the cost of university courses during this pandemic, when the uni experience is no longer even half as good as it was. I have no motivation to study in that environment and them doubling the cost has pretty much made me think no way. my age group has the lowest employment rate yet we are the most inelligible for government support in this time. I am sick of trying when everything is made harder, and then my problems are minimized because I am young. I feel like my youth was destroyed by this toxic society, i never got to live the life I wanted, and now covid has trapped me even further in this miserable cycle. I really can't believe that I am nearly 30, basically begging for entry level work or welfare and can't get fucking either. I don't know what I will do in a few months time.",

Her regret was around committing to something where we dont understand the long term effects, the fact that they have only emergency approval; mainly afraid of the unknown around the vaccination she received.

But like my mom is a little bit more paranoid about Covid than I am. Her and I got into it on Tuesday because I told her that I was going with him and she was mad that I was even thinking of going (this was on the heels of my niece getting Covid as well the same day) because I was putting her at risk mind you guys, were both fully vaccinated. Now Im starting to have second thoughts about going with him. He just got over Covid so Im not worried about catching Covid from him. But like still. I havent seen him in a while so it would be nice, but hes pretty insistent on going there himself. Like I dont know what to do now tbh",

He has given presentations on how the pandemic will effect the economy and future as well and I do research for him as a job. He said that pandemics come in waves of 3 or 5. We are on wave 4. As grim as that sounds that a 5th wave could be coming, the good news is that I can promise it will end in mid 2022. The WHO set that goal. Vaccines are being more rolled out not just in the USA. <PERSON> is putting vaccine mandates wherever he can. Covid will eventually run out of people to infect on top of the vaccines. No plague has ever lasted forever. The most important thing that we smart vaccinated folks can do is continue to be optimistic and take solace in both history and the predictions of the WHO. We will be ok, this will end, and life will return. Things may be different in the end but there is an end and life will come back. Stay positive, stay optimistic, and stay safe.",

On one hand: I have anti-COVID vax family, one of which used to be in medicine. She keeps sending me emails about end times, vax passport=persecution and even mixes in some messages with medical information about the danger of a rushed vaccine, unknown long-term effects, etc. In addition to this, they also mentioned an incident from the past when I had a terrible reaction to the DTaP vaccine as an infant, as proof that I should be leery of getting this vaccine (although Ive been getting other vaccines as recently as January of last year without issue). Im being pelted with this information all the time, and its hard to turn it off when it comes from family members you love and trust. On the other hand: I caught COVID in November and am still sorta messed up. Smell and taste arent the same, chronic insomnia and brain fog I dont wish this on anyone, and I consider myself lucky for having such a mild case. I just want this to be done for all of us, want to help things go back to whatever normal was, and want to keep myself out of the hospital. Im an uninsured freelancer, and am afraid of what a potential serious case of COVID would do to me. I just need to hear that Ill be OK. Im sorry if this sounds too needy coming from an adult, but Im emotionally exhausted. Any kind words would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

He's 62 years old, no previous physical conditions, but he didn't get any of the vaccines because he fell down the anti-vax/covid conspiracy hole. My uncle had to literally drag him to the hospital because he refused to get help. He knew he had covid and wouldn't admit it, putting not only himself but my 84 year old grandma and my two uncles in danger. One of them (the one who ended up dragging him to the ER) has fybromialgia, so his health is also incredibly compromised because of that. Yet he risked his life for my dad. Luckily, no one else ended up as bad as he is right now because they all got vaccinated back in the day, and only got infected but had very few symptoms. As far as the situation with my dad goes, doctors have been honest with us, and although it is not impossible for my dad to get out of this, he's in a very very critical state. Because of this, I've barely been able to eat or sleep, anxiety is eating me alive and I've started to notice how this is affecting my moods. I can barely get a hold of myself. I'm extremely angry and sad and resentful and tired. All at the same time. I've started to snap at people, and I have the constant need to scream until my throat breaks. I literally feel like I'm going insane. I've read about his complications and how fucked they are, and I realize that doctors can only do so much and chances of him making it out are very slim. Everyone around me is trying to be supportive, and say things like \"don't loose your faith\", \"as long as he's alive there's a chance\", and YES, there's obviously still hope but it's honestly maddening. Not even the doctors know what the hell is going to happen because that's what covid does. One day they're fine, and literally hours later they're dying. How am I not supposed to loose my shit? The waiting is killing me. Anyone going/has gone through a similar situation? Any advice? Please help.",

I would lose all hope and purpose for anything. Its just so hard to be anything but pessimistic and fatalistic these days :(",

I had COVID back in November, and at 6 months after infection, I got my antibody levels tested and was surprised to see I still had antibodies. My numerical result (on a <ORG> Elecsys test testing for Spike Protein Antibodies) was 246. Two months later I tested again (I was curious about rate of decline) and was at 226. I'm feeling like it's probably time to get vaccinated despite my previous infection, but I'm really curious to see how much higher vaccine-level antibodies are than my current levels. I know individual levels can vary and that we still don't know what antibody levels = immunity, but it would still be interested to know the common ranges seen after vaccination. Has anyone else gotten a test for the spike protein antibodies post vaccination? Would love to hear your results if you feel comfortable sharing. P.S. I'm basing my vaccination decisions off expert recommendations and studies surrounding reinfection rates/previous immunity vs vaccination immunity, etc. not off this Reddit thread - don't worry. :) But as someone who has a little bit of nervousness around taking any medication and who loves data, this type of information gives me more confidence in my decision.",

But the government just announced they will delay the gap between the two <ORG> shots from 21 days to 12 weeks 12 weeks!! They already did it with <ORG>. Theres no enough scientific evidence to support this, theyre doing it because we dont have enough vaccines and Im not sure how this is going to affect the immunity response. It makes me so angry because the government negotiated the vaccines with several pharmaceuticals since last year but this companies are delaying the vaccines supplies and we have received a minimum of what we purchased. And I think this happens in other third world countries. Is so unfair to see how wealthy nations are already applying boosters meanwhile here we have nothing! At this rate were never going to achieve a good level of protection until who knows when :(",

I'm classed as at risk and spent much of my childhood in hospitals which is why I've been extra careful. Due to circumstances with my anxiety preventing me from working, I'm moving in with my elderly grandmother where I intend to remain cautious. My grandmother still goes out, eats at pubs, goes to church, does not wear a mask in a taxi, etc. But I still have added anxiety about infecting her if I were to catch the virus. Onto the main topic: My best friends are getting married in October (6 weeks from now) and I've known about this for some time. They just asked me to confirm if I will attend the wedding as a bridesmaid. I haven't see a friend in almost 2 years at this point and get anxiety answering the door for deliveries, going to the shop, etc. There will be up to 40 guests in a room with a maximum capacity of 40. I live in the UK, so cases are fairly high and nothing like mask wearing or social distancing are mandated now. Logically I know that this is a high risk scenario, emotionally I am super anxious that if I don't go, I will lose my friends. I'm so anxious that I haven't even been able to reply with a yes or no or to share my concerns. What would you do? TLDR: I have bad anxiety, haven't seen friends in 2 years, live with elderly grandmother, and have been invited to be a bridesmaid at my best friends wedding. I get anxious just answering the door for deliveries or when going shopping for food. I'm also anxious I'll lose my friend if I can't go. Help!",

I'm sick of this insipid messaging that society considers it a worse fate to exist in a body like mine than to be severely ill.

I live with my parents, one of whom has had historic lung issues, is 71, and also probably high risk. We're all fully vaccinated. My goal, really, throughout all this is to reduce my chance of *infection* to near zero. It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid. I know being vaccinated my chances of hospitalization and death are low, that's not really what I'm worried about. I'm a wind player, and theoretically have an orchestra concert coming up mid september. I'm in Oregon where cases are pretty out of control. From what research I've seen, playing a wind instrument is essentially identical to just talking in terms of risk factor. So that's fine. Assuming no precautions are taken, that'll be something like 20 people within 15 feet of me, possibly unvaccinated, unmasked, not particularly well ventilated space, for multiple hours. To me that is very clearly an untenable risk, even though I am vaccinated. I guess the first gut check - am I already being over-cautious in thinking that? If I'm right that that is way too risky. What precautions would be reasonable to ask for? If everyone is vaccinated, all non-wind players are masked, and I'm 6 feet away from everyone else, that's about as many mitigating factors as possible - and I honestly can't tell if that's enough to be safe or not. It's still being unmasked in a room full of people for hours, doing an activity that for me involves a lot of deep breaths. I suspect, on one hand, I may be too cautious in thinking those measures wouldn't be enough? and the other hand I can't help but shake the fear that it won't work out okay",

Looking back, I can't say for sure, but I feel like I had trouble sleeping the last time, too. I think I wrote it off at the time as being unrelated because everyone has trouble sleeping sometimes. I've heard some anecdotal accounts of similar difficulty falling asleep after the COVID vaccine and flu shots, but I don't remember anything about it in the <ORG> or <ORG> clinical trials, but I could have overlooked that if it was mentioned because I was more focused on things like fever and gastrointestinal upset. I'm not especially concerned, except maybe about the lack of sleep making that general gross feeling worse or last longer, so I'm considering taking a benadryl or something to knock me out. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.",

Myself, my daughter (5), son (2), and partner. Myself and my partner are both vaccinated w/ <ORG> shots. Monday August 9th - My daughter was exposed to COVID-19 Thursday August 12th - My daughter begins to experience symptoms of COVID-19. Sunday August 15th - My daughter tests positive for COVID-19. Myself and my partner test negative via a rapid antigen test. We begin our isolation. We are told Monday August 23rd we should be safe to end isolation. Tuesday August 17th - My 2 yr old son begins to show signs of fever. We do not test him. Saturday August 20st - My partner begins to experience COVID-19 symtoms. Sunday August 22nd - My partner tests positive for COVID-19 via rapid antigen test. I test negative via rapid antigen test (Today). &amp;#x200B; So tomorrow we were supposed to go off isolation. Obviously, that's not happening w/ a positive test from my partner. What should I do? Should I continue to isolate w/ my family? Should I get a hotel room? Should my partner get a hotel room and isolate from the rest of the family with my son while my daughter comes off isolation w/ me?? I don't want to abandon my family but I feel helpless. My fears are I will contract COVID in the coming days and the isolation \"timer\" will reset or worse, I will contract COVID-19 and suffer serious health issues. Any advice on what I should do and how everyone should proceed?",

My wife is an ICU nurse and has been working with Covid patients really since April 2020. She was a travel nurse when the pandemic happened, up north. My mother passed away a couple of months before Covid came to the US. She was only 57. Needless to say we have had a rush of emotions the last two years. I say all of this to say Im lost, and I feel hopeless. We are both vaccinated, and have had our scares. She got vaccinated early on in December for obvious reasons. I was lucky in the fact I worked under the department of health umbrella for the state, and got my last <ORG> shot in Feb 2021. She recently got Covid like a month ago, mild symptoms, we assume Delta. Lucky when I was tested, I surprisingly came back negative. So we are back to the norm if you will. However that lingering feeling of doom hangs over me. Im 30 years old, 60, and close to 300lbs. I know thats a risk factor, but my ice points out I have no other issues. I gained a lot of this weight in the last four years. I used to actually run half marathons and be fit. Im just still scared of getting Covid, and dying or getting long term side effects.. I do look for support from my wife, but I know she can only take so much, given her work place. I guess Im just looking for a steady view and direction, of how I should view my situation. Im scared, tired, hopeless, exhausted.",

Over the last 17 months of this pandemic Canada has been under much harsher restrictions compared to the rest of North America. Not only that but we have also had much stricter and longer lockdowns, even though our infection numbers have been lower then other places with similar restrictons. I too have recently have had a lot anxiety of another lockdown with cases going up in my province (Quebec) because I know its not going to take much for the goverment to send us back to the same place we were in the Winter (curfew included). Im terrfied of the fact of losing more of University years. My mental health tanked with online learning. It also tanked by having all my outlets taken away. Im sick of being scared of this. It sucks that I still have to be this terrfied because are vaccine numbers are good, but its clear they are not enough to go back to even some form of normal. At this point a year ago I was sure I would never fear another lockdown by this time, but I cleary was very naive. Not that you could blame me.",

We're both fully vaccinated and Paris (where we'd spend most of our time) seems to be doing well with vaccination rates and requiring vaccines to do most activities. However, we planned this trip in mid-June when things seemed like they were getting better-- now, with Delta, it's feeling a bit riskier to attempt international travel. My question is, which factors would you weigh the heaviest if you were thinking about traveling? Right now the thing I'm most worried about is getting a positive test before returning to the US and having to quarantine in Paris-- that would be a whole mess. But I don't know if that's reason enough to cancel the whole trip, and after a year and a half of being stuck at home, I desperately want to go. (For the record, I'm young, healthy, work from home, and don't have regular contact with unvaccinated or immunocompromised people.)",

I know this is relatively \"recent\" and my antibodies shouldn't have waned too much, but I'll be working in a school from September. Luckily it's a small private school and masks are mandatory, but my students are very young and can't wear them very well. I live with my parents, and my mom works in a hospital and my dad is very high risk. They will both be in the first groups officially eligible for a booster shot but I don't think that will come until late September. Furthermore, I'm a former smoker with possible asbestos exposure in the past, so while my lungs are fine for now they are very vulnerable to damage. Getting this job has disqualified me from Medicaid, so I won't have health insurance for the next month either. I'm terrified of catching Delta and 1. suffering permanent damage, 2. incurring huge medical debt, and 3. passing it to my parents before they can get a booster. My dad would not survive a COVID infection. If you were in my situation, do you think it would be worth \"sneaking\" a third dose of pfizer or even a booster of J&amp;J for extra protection? I will be double-masking at work with a KN95 and surgical mask, but schools are such a high-risk environment that I don't feel comfortable even with that.",

Having had two doses of <ORG> (just about - I got my second dose on the same day I think I contracted Covid), my symptoms have been fairly mild and I have nearly completely recovered. However (and here is my problem), I am due to fly to Canada from England on the 3rd September, which will require a pre-departure and post-arrival test. Even though I will no longer be infectious, I am seriously concerned that I might still be testing positive for Covid and thus be barred from flying. Has anyone got any information on how long it takes to finally test negative, particularly for someone who is double vaccinated? I have found some information saying it can often be as much as a a month, however others dispute this in certain cases. Many thanks!",

Cases were so low where I lived that I never had to worry about covid and lived a normal life (minus border closings and not being allowed to leave my country). I (double vaccinated with sinopharm) went to dinner with a friend (double vaccinated with sinovac) on Wednesday night inside and Thursday afternoon symptoms hit her suddenly and she received her positive results Thursday evening. Her whole family now has to quarantine for 2 weeks and I do too as a close contact. I need to test tomorrow but so far have no symptoms other than anxiety and a hoarse voice. I am feeling immense guilt that I may have given her covid. She was always so careful and doesnt deserve this nor does her family. I never felt sick but I went on a day hike with 5 other people over the weekend and my mask broke on the ride home so I was partially unmasked in the van till we stopped and I bought another bag of masks. How do I live with my guilt over this and the stigma that I may have given someone covid?",

I had heard that it was typically recommended to chemo patients, as the treatments can destroy your smell and taste in a similar way that Covid does. I lost my smell and taste in Nov of last year, and it's been very difficult to deal with ever since. You should be able to find it at Walmart or Walgreens, and most pharmacies should carry them. You don't need a prescription to buy them, either. I personally have been taking it for about a week now, and I have noticed some changes. My smell isn't totally back, but I can tell that it's improving. I'm wondering if I'll have to take a stinger dose seeing as it's been so long. We'll just have to wait and see. Just wanted to share with others currently struggling to find something to help. If you Google alpha lipoic acid, the first thing that comes up is smell loss do due upper respiratory infections. I hope this finds anyone who may need it! If anyone is interested, I'm more than happy to make updates regarding my own recovery while taking them if anyone is skeptical.",

I thought being vaccinated would lend some type of protection I havent done anything too crazy (no trips no parties nothing) the craziest thing I did is probably going to the gym and taking off my mask, its not even a full gym. Were socially distanced. Yesterday I woke up with a killer sore throat, I went to gettested results were negative. Today I wake up with no sore throat but gradually started sneezing so I thought might as well take another test so I got an at home test. Clearly negative on the test. I dont know what Im doing at this point and I dont know how to handle this logically. I booked a PCR test for Friday night, Im thinking by then it would show on a home test if Im really positive. Im 26 years old and yes havw both shots so I thought I wouldnt need to worry about breakthrough infections but Im seeing more and more of it. At work people are coughing and sneezing around me. We all wear masks but Im wondering how many people are walking around thinking they have allergies when its covid. This is a special type of hell. Ive had sore throats before this pandemic and they went away; but this time it turned into sneezing and runny noses. What do I do, do I wait a couple days and test again? I have no other symptoms besides the sneezing. No fever nothing.",

However, the wedding will be attended by 100+ people from all over the country and other countries. With cases rising and hospitals being overrun, I explained they should implement a vaccine-only rule for guests, with proof of vaccination sent beforehand and rapid tests at the door. I got pushback because they \"can't\" tell people they can only attend if they're vaccinated. I told them they can since it's their wedding. Their plan is to have \"spaced seating\" and \"strongly suggest\" that people be vaccinated and have everyone wear masks. If there's anything this pandemic has taught us, it is that people will lie and do whatever they want to. Of course the proof can be faked, but it's still better than nothing. Furthermore, it's unrealistic to expect everyone to keep masks on the whole time at a wedding where people will be eating, drinking, dancing, having conversations, taking pictures, and trying to hear each other over music. They're the ones choosing to go through with an indoor wedding during a pandemic, but I'm being treated as if I'm completely unreasonable. It seems extremely irresponsible to me. Having a bunch of people attend an indoor wedding and then fly back to their respective homes. I'm vaccinated but I would still very much prefer to not catch this virus, minimal symptoms or not. It's like I have to accept possibly getting the virus for this wedding and I don't know what to do.",

I'm almost waiting for them to say that they've got 500K+cases per day. It's only getting worse and take this with a grain of salt but I feel like the vaccinations are so slow that there's no way we can beat this until it burns out on its own. Why can't people just listen in the damn first place?! We were so close to the end. So so close. Now, another year with masks, lockdowns all over the world, and avoiding doing pretty much everything except taking a walk from time to time, or going to appointments. I'm so so tired. I lost the first few years of my 20s to this. I lost my sense of taste/smell for 6 months to this ! I lost my appetite and so much of my mental and physical health to this.. I cancelled everything I cared about and stayed almost completely alone for almost TWO YEARS NOW for this! I don't want to sound uncaring, but I want to be selfish too. I want to enjoy something that's not a nature hike or clapping because we got something a little extra in our grocery delivery. Therapy isn't working for this. I don't want to keep coping with \"this is the way it is.\" I'm not even looking for normalcy. I'm looking for a reason to live anymore. To put up with the lockdowns and quarantining for another year. Booster shots possibly every 6-9 months - I just can't! I'm so freaking miserable and I feel like I have so little to be happy about anymore.",

All the people I once felt safe with either refuse to get vaccinated or arent being as cautious anymore. I live with my super careful brother and see my boyfriend on the weekends, but Im basically alone 90% of the time. Im always stressed about my loved ones, especially my best friend, who wont budge on getting the vaccine. Im scared Im going to lose her and anytime Ive tried to talk to her about it, she gets upset. All the hobbies I took up last year dont feel safe anymore because Im too scared to go outside. On top of COVID, Im also just dealing with a recent OCD diagnosis and lots of death/trauma/loss around me. Last year it felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel. This year it feels like we can physically see the light, but no one wants to reach it. I just feel incredibly alone and utterly hopeless. It feels like this will never end.",

While my parents are normally pretty reasonable, for whatever reason they bought into all the propaganda against the Covid vaccines. While I wanted to get it and was eligible months ago, I wasn't allowed. They seemed so very genuinely worried that it would hurt me, and it was emotionally taxing to keep arguing against them. They wouldn't listen. Since I don't leave the house much, I figured it would be okay to give up. I agreed to wait until FDA approval, then get it. In a case of the worst possible timing ever, though, just as a vaccine receives full approval, there's been an outbreak at my father's workplace. A big one. He tested negative four days ago, and hasn't been to work for unrelated reasons since then, but I'm still scared. I've asked him to mask, isolate, even open a window and he's said no. Every time he coughs within earshot, I want to claw my eyes out. So, while I've finally got a vaccine appointment for 2 days from now, I'm worried it's too late. I'm taking my temperature constantly, checking my breathing, washing my hands like crazy, wiping stuff down... I don't know what else to do. And I keep ruminating over how, if I do get sick, people will think I deserve it since I'm not vaccinated. They'll think I'm just one of the idiots. But I swear I didn't want to be, I really would've gotten it day 1 if I weren't so scared of confrontation. I guess this isn't much more than a vent. Logically I know I'll probably be okay. Even if I get it, I'm 29. A little overweight, out of shape, but no other health issues. But I just needed to say, somewhere, that this isn't entirely my fault. I'm not stupid, just... cowardly. And I'll be vaccinated soon. I just hope it isn't too late.",

Now, I am tired of waiting, being the good civilian staying home as much as possible and still following all the guidelines while all of UK is out being neglectful(imho) ,and I really want to visit them now. (I wont if things are still too crazy) So here I am looking into things, checking both the UK and Dutch gov sites. And I just can't get my head around it on my own. So here is where I ask you lot. Please help me clarify and figure out what I would need to do to safely travel, following all the guidelines. Some things to note: * I will want to travel with my SO. (I have a Dutch passport and my SO UK) * We are both fully vaccinated and working from home. * Is there a difference with traveling by airplane or by car. (I.E. Do we still need to do multiple PCR tests when traveling by car? What about isolating when we stay at my parents place) * I would like to visit between October and December. (this is just a guide date, I know things could possibly change and there is no guarantee) * It would max be a week long stay. I am just looking for help to figure out what I would need to do if I would travel both by airplane or car. From quarantining, to tests, to documentation. Preferable a clear overview or step by step kind of thing. Thanks for your help in advance.",

Except, the test came back positive. I was starting to panic when i realised I'd been eating blackcurrant flavoured throat soothers all day for my sore throat, and remembered hearing a lot about blackcurrant causing false positives, so should i be worried? I'm going to take another test in a bit to make sure. What do i do if i take multiple tests and the rest of them are negative? Thankyou in advance!",

It was just sniffling which could be allergies but i was PANICKING. she was in another cublicle, we never talked or shared anything. We just were in the same room. I am vaccinated.

My sister has been wanting to get her covid shots these past few months, but my parents have been hesitant about the vaccine and are being stubborn and won't take her to get them. She has heart problems and a weaker immune system so I have been very worried for her. My sister is now 17, so she has about another year until she is 18 and can get vaccinated without parental consent from what I understand. Now that it is FDA approved, I was wondering if anything has changed with the ability for her to go and get it herself in California? Thanks for any info you all can provide us.",

So far, we've just done outdoor dates, because me and my family are playing it pretty safe with the pandemic. I see a high risk family member pretty often, so that's a factor for me. I've told him this, and although he's not playing it as safe in his own life, he respects it. However, last night at the end of the date, he wanted to kiss, and while I said no due to having to social distance, it prompted me to think...what would the future of us dating look like? Obviously, physical touch is part of a relationship and idk how long he'll wait to even be able to hug me. Do I ask him to reconsider his safety precautions? Do we both get tested before we hangout? What's fair to ask of him? I really wanna make it work, but protecting my family is important too. Oh, and a little more info, we're both vaccinated, but he's going on without a mask, and into pretty public, crowded places. I still wear my mask everywhere but the outdoors and avoid busy, crowded places. The only people my family would be comfortable with me having around without any precautions is someone who is living similarly. (They do like this guy tho, despite his different safety choices).",

I hate wearing masks so much, I don't want to go back to wearing them (I've barely been out since the guidelines updated), but I really, really don't want to go back to being online. Are things going to get better any time soon?",

I honestly dont know what it would take to convince him to get vaccinated. I tried to talk with him about this back in February, and it got **bad**. The convo (well, more like argument) ended with both of us crying. Hes just hell-bent on believing that the vaccine is terrible and killing more people than covid is (yes. He said this to me the other day.). Its beyond frustrating and I dont know if I should try, again, to tell him I want him to get vaccinated. Im afraid that hell catch covid, die (God my chest got tight typing that out) and that Ill always feel like I could have done more to try to convince him. I know its ultimately his choice, and I can only control what *I* do, but I still worry. When my dad isnt in his conspiracy theory mode, hes one of my favorite people ever Is anyone else dealing with something like this?",

We have planned this for a while and we already had a lot of ongoing work from before COVID. If I drop out now I don't know if they want to do it without me, or might kick me out of the group. However it suddenly turns out one other person, let's call them Person-X, is unvaccinated. Person-X claimed that the vaccine was only available when they were away from home for a week as an excuse. But that is wrong, it's easy to get a vaccine where we live. I already have 2 doses. I didn't say that because I didn't want to start an argument. Person-X has earlier said they did not care about the vaccine so I think this is the true cause. I don't want to spend hours inside a relatively small room with Person-X now because it's not safe enough. I currently value having good health a lot. It's just not worth it to me. :/ I don't want to be rude to the group and let them down after all this planning. Especially as Person-X claimed the vaccine was not available. How do I express concerns, and say that I don't want to show up anymore? We have a group chat I can use. I could tell them to continue to work without me but they specified that everyone should show up next time...",

How can I avoid getting sick? He is being respectful and is wearing a mask anytime hes in the shared space and is wiping things down. Ive disinfected most of anything that would be touched, and Ive also turned on the ceiling fan, AC, and cracked the windows open (I said I would cover the electric bill). What else can I do as a precaution. Is it likely for me to be exposed to the virus anytime I use the kitchen? There are no windows over there or ways to air it out, really: 2. Do I need to self isolate? We both go to the same university and he said student health would reach out to me with info but they have not sent me anything yet. I have no symptoms. 3. Does anyone have testimonies of similar situations where you had to live with someone who got COVID? Did you end up getting sick? What did you do? Let me know, and thanks for the help!",

On Sunday my girlfriend hung out with her friend who was vaccinated and asymptomatic, had a negative rapid test, but later (on Tuesday) started developing symptoms and got a positive PCR result from Sunday. I hung out with my girlfriend on Monday and we made out for a bit but only hung out for about an hour or two. From what I can gather, my exposure seems relatively low because even if my girlfriend's risk is high, I saw her around 24 hours after her exposure. But what do y'all think? I'm only concerned about spreading it to my family.",

I've been tense the past couple of weeks worried about COVID exposure, so I was positive it was just my TMJ acting up. Hadn't slept well then I woke up today with a vaguely scratchy throat. Which, is not uncommon for me, because I sleep with a fan blowing in my face all night. But I just started crying at this point. I'm vaccinated. I've been doing my best to keep safe. I had lunch with a friend yesterday and I think it would devastate me if I got her sick. But my symptoms aren't common COVID symptoms. But the more I think about them, the more I feel like, I feel them. And then more symptoms pop up. Do I feel vaguely achy or is this the anxiety? I feel hot, but take my temperature and it's normal. I feel short of breath, but I use my oximeter and my levels are fine. I start googling and panicking over and over. I try to distract myself, which makes my symptoms so much less. But soon the anxiety creeps up again and I spiral. I feel so exhausted now. I thought I was doing well with my COVID anxiety but between these events I attended and people in my office testing positive, I went back to square one for a bit.",

He's also very quick to use the bathroom as well. I have another housemate who moved in recently and he's the same. Never washed his hands. My bedroom is right beside one of the bathrooms that we all use. I can hear everything. I can hear him do his business, he will then flush and then walk straight out of the bathroom. Someone else I work with and using shared bathrooms, she splashes her hands with water and that's it. Why is this basic hygiene technique too much for some people?",

I live 7 hours from campus and she swears there are testing centers available in all locations. I called my local community college and they arent offering proctored tests this year due to the pandemic. Told my professor, no response. I have bad anxiety and I literally do not go into buildings hardly ever since the pandemic started. I am terrified of going into a testing center during the fall and winter just to take a test. When covid cases will be increasing during the winter months more than likely. The two 4 year universities in my area are already talking about going online only this semester. So I honestly feel like Ill have nowhere to take these exams. To me this professor is coming off as insensitive and uncaring, and rather tone deaf regarding the pandemic. This should not be allowed. Any advice is appreciated.. mainly just wanted to rant. P.S. to add, the school I go to has technology that allows them to proctor tests from home. But apparently this isnt good enough for my professor.",

My mom is vaccinated with J&amp;J since March and my dad is unvaccinated. They both had moderate symptoms, went to the doctor and were prescribed a few things. My mom is feeling almost normal again and she seems pretty fine. My dad is doing better than he was, but I don't think he's quite back to normal compared to how quickly my mom bounced back. When I found out they both had it, I decided to stay in my room, upstairs, because I was in a position to do so and I really didn't want to take any risks. I had a limited amount of groceries up here that I have been eating, but I'm almost out, am probably eating too little, and it's really starting to get to me mentally. I went downstairs earlier, masked, because I realize it has been over 10 days and they're both clearly improving though my dad is still coughing quite a bit and lethargic. I'm too freaked out to do it again, really. I'm fully vaccinated but the risk was still there so I have been doing everything in my power to avoid contact. Even being in the kitchen knowing that my dad had been in there a few hours prior makes me uncomfortable. I really just want to eat a hot, normal, meal. Realistically, am I safe to go downstairs and cook food? I just don't want to take any risk. I understand it's been over 10 days but it's just so hard to make the move and make my brain realize that.",

It's been difficult to quarantine for the rest of my family as we live in a 2bd/1ba apt with a 1.5 yo. So my question is - how long must my wife and child also quarantine before they are cleared? What if they continue to test negative throughout the next few days until I'm presenting no clear symptoms? More context - my wife and daughter both tested negative the following Sunday 08/29. Wife has presented mild symptoms somewhat similar to mine (sore throat, headache, etc) a day after the PCR test. Both my wife and I have had our first shot of the mRNA vaccine (<ORG> and <ORG> respectively). She continues to be okay and not worsen like I have. We will take another test by the end of this week - if it comes back negative and no present symptoms for all members of the family, are we clear? Hopefully that was clear and concise - trying to figure this out has been the opposite lol",

One of my good buddies just informed the group chat last night that he tested positive for Covid four days ago (Thursday), and showed flu-like symptoms at the beginning of the week (Monday). He said that he is feeling better, and by the time we leave for the trip, which is this Thursday it will be 10 days he's been in isolation and according to the CDC, he should be cleared to resocialize and therefore not miss the trip. I know there are a lot of factors and it's hard to determine when it might be safe to be around others, but that time frame still seems very tight. For the record, everyone in our party is fully vaccinated, so there is some protection. But we will be in tight quarters for a few days, and I'll be in close contact with family for some time after this trip. We are all getting tested, and he said he will as well. There is a light understanding that if he tests positive that he won't go, but he has been kind of forward stating that there is a high probability he will even if he is \"Not Contagious\". Which makes me feel like he might try to attend regardless. The fact that it's a breakthrough infection is making me feel a little overly cautious about wanting to attend. Overall, is that timeline a little too tight or am I overthinking things? \\------------------------------------------- **TL;DR** \\- A friend had a breakthrough infection less than a week ago, showing flu-like symptoms. He's feeling better, but would like to still attend a trip we leave for this week, which would mark exactly 10 days he's been in isolation since showing symptoms but would be 7 days after he's tested positive. Is that timeframe too tight, and am I overthinking about not attending the trip?",

Apparently he got it at school after they started a week ago. He got tested today as the school had been getting reports on several other students testing positive. He had his confirmation yesterday and I as well as other family members were present. Which has me a bit worried (My family and importantly my grandparents who were there are fully vaccinated) yet I am still worried, especially for my brother. I am worried he will feel like this is his fault. The whole situation is just really stressful. I live in another city and traveled home last night (wearing a mask and keeping my distance to other people) but I am still worried about having spread the virus as I took a train home. I have scheduled a test for myself tomorrow and am really hoping I test negative. I live quite far away and they are swamped with informing the rest of the attendees about how to proceed. Luckily most of the guests (with the exception of three teenagers) were vaccinated. There weren't that many guests though just 13 - 15. However I just feel stressed and worried about this whole affair. Wondering if I should reach out to my brother to let him know that it is not his fault or if I should just let him be and keep communication restricted to my parents until he feels better (He has light symptoms for now).

We took them off to eat and drink but wore them for everything else. I felt SO awkward and out of place. We also decided mostly not to dance because the dance floor was very crowded and a few inches from each other and it made me nervous. At some points we were literally the only people at the tables and stuck out like sore thumbs. The worst was the judgmental comments. Most people were fine and just stared at us curiously and did not say anythingone person (an old high school friend) respectfully asked my level of comfort with chatting and elbow bumped my husband hello.

Im a med phobe. Like getting my tetanus booster was a huge deal...really... Reasons I got vaccinated. And it is a few reasons I will lump into one. Stats prove the vaccine works period. It works. It may not prevent Covid but it will damn sure 95 times out of 100 keep you from dying alone on a vent or being hospitalized alone. I am also still hopeful that vaccinated folks spread less. I know thats somewhat still up in the air. My experience. Shot one. Arm hurt. And I mean cant lift it kind of hurt. It was bad. But that was it. Nothing else, no fever, chills, headache, nothing. Shot two. Arm pain much less than the first. Thats it. I vaccinated with <ORG>. If you have not done it. Please do. You are helping yourself and others.",

My uncle's responses included the following: -I'm not going to the wedding -That is an insane thing to request -I'm sorry you have been brainwashed -vaccinated people spread the virus more than unvaccinated people -the vaccines infect you with the virus and make you a carrier Mind you that my aunt and her husband are also both healthcare professionals. I guess I mostly just needed to rant, but it's also extremely upsetting to hear things like this. We've been hearing crap like this from anti-vaxxers all along, but it hits differently when it's coming directly from someone you know, and someone you're related to on top of that. I don't plan on getting involved in this argument whatsoever, but I truly just don't understand how and why people think like this.

I know people who have basically been going the whole pandemic. I was hoping to return after getting my shots. Before the pandemic, I went 3x weekly, and I loved it. I've been doing home workouts, but I find it harder to stay consistent and it's the one day-to-day activity that I really miss. Right now my area hasn't actually gotten out of its third wave and there's already news of a fourth on the way. I'm waiting to see if the case numbers drop at all before buying a membership again. I'm feeling conflicted, but my mental health has been in various states of 'bad' for this entire time and going to the gym used to be a huge help for handling depression. For people who have gone back to the gym, how do you feel about it? Do people still wear masks there (it's mandatory where I live but not enforced)? Is there anything I can do to be extra safe when I do return?",

Even when the cdc first said in May that people can unmask and cases were super low before delta most therapists didn't return too the office. And when companies tried getting people too go back too the office before delta a lot of people got pretty upset and if they threatened too cut pay most people said they would rather make less money than work in an office. And I just feel like high paying office jobs are gonna be online forever because most people don't like going too the office it seems. And same deal for therapists because of the crazy amount of money they will save not having an office. Right now I've been trying too find a therapist for months and I've had close too 0 luck. The few that I found charge insane amounts like 150 a session which I could never afford. And I'm not very hopeful that office jobs and in person therapy will be a thing after the delta variant",

I quarantine from the family that I do live with because they go outside, and I get severe anxiety from so much as a trip to the grocery store etc. However, I recently got into my absolute DREAM university, which under normal conditions I would be so overjoyed and excited to attend ASAP. However, things are going to be in person, and I just don't know if I can handle the sudden shift from not leaving my room (let alone my house) at all, to being in multiple classrooms full of students multiple times a week, and living in a dormroom. I know an overwhelming majority of the people at the university are vaccinated (\\~90-95%), masks are enforced, as is weekly testing. But at the same time there is a surge of delta, the rate of breakthroughs, and I was someone who got the vaccine early on - consequently I anticipate that there is a level of reduced efficacy until my 3rd booster as well. So I know there are reasons for me to go, but also legitimate reasons (including just anxiety and the effects on academic performance and wellbeing that may have in its own right) that make me hesitant. How do I weigh a decision like this? When is it genuinely just being appropriately cautions vs avoidant behavior related to me being overly anxious about Covid? Would deferral be an appropriate thing to be considering? Even if I defer theres no guarantee that things will get better? What exactly would I be waiting for if I do defer? &amp;#x200B; I would really appreciate any outside perspective and advice - just curious what others may think! Thanks a million !",

Side effects were TERRIBLE. Tingling/numbing in left side of face and lips and tongue feeling heavy and numb with extreme headache/head pressure. Neuropathy in all fingers and toes..Extreme nerve pain in left leg that would come and go..Heart racing/heart palpitations..Chest pain and tightness and feeling like I cant breathDizziness..Feeling extremely light headed when getting upEpisodes of room spinning .. lasted about 2..3 weeks. I havent taken the second dose, and I dont know if I should take it due to the side effects I experienced. Its ultimately up to me as Ive gotten mixed messages from doctors. My lungs cant handle COVId due to the treatments I received and at the same time Im not sure I can handle more of what I experienced after first dose.

I administered an antigen test on both of them Saturday night, both negative. I had an antigen test done on me today, although it was out of precaution from work, no symptoms. That means it was 4 days since they were sneezing and coughing all over us. My wife and I do not have any symptoms. Should I just accept that it isnt covid.",

Talking about co-morbidities and about how hes not responsible for other peoples health and talking about \"2%\" rates. I dont want to provide the direct articles and videos we were discussing cause I dont want to become part of the problem by accident. Now... I know vaccines work. But I dont know how to eloquently explain this in a concrete fashion without shoving scifi and video game references all through it, to the point it loses cohesion. How do you start convincing people that... well I mean all of society functions of off science. If \"the gubmint\" was using science to \"trick us out of Gods love\", or whatever, jew-lasers or the craziness they say was true, then frickin planes wouldnt fly. Boats wouldnt float. We wouldnt have nuclear reactors or submarines. The proof is in the pudding: we scrutinize each other and \"the pack\" finds the truth through consensus. Like were talking about the very fabric of our culture, the basic trust of our own SPECIES. I tried to put things in context, explain and provide OLD resources pre-pandemic to sway his mind but he isnt being receptive. How do you start breaking this down for someone?

The other employees are pretty lax with masks, eat and drink freely, etc since we are all in the same bubble and don't really go anywhere (and when they have, they've gotten tested before and after). I've also started being more relaxed now that I'm vaccinated. I don't panic if my one! mask isn't so snug my face hurts. I took off my mask indoors! to eat lunch with everyone. It's so liberating and it feels so good, and I feel like Delta is so contagious that normal surgical masks probably wouldn't prevent infection anyway even if we were all 100% diligent. But after a year and a half of driving myself insane, I'm struggling with the guilt of relaxing. I feel like I'm being irresponsible. Is this normal? Am I a bad person or stupid for relaxing a bit? I guess I just need reassurance, please tell me this is okay (or that it's not and I need to be more (responsible).",

She stood at the door with it open, and my dad stopped and never came within 10 feet of her. Probably closer to 15 feet. He sat the bags down and quickly turned and walked back to the car. They were both wearing masks. He was probably within 15-20 feet for like 15 seconds. Im just mortified he mustve gotten it somehow. I wish she didnt walk outside and part of me is mad at her for it, but I know she just didnt think of that and I shouldnt be upset with her.

No matter what resources I give her all I get is \"vaccines are designed to kill people\" she legitimately believe that vaccines are created for the killing of people. I just got my first shot today. And she keeps asking if \"I'm okay.\" She describes symptoms like necrosis of the entire body. Random organ failure. The even claimed that people are \"legit\" melting from the inside. She also asked me to stick a magnet on my arm where I got my shot and it would stick because \"They\" put Graphene and aluminum in the vaccines. I once heard a claim of anti-freeze being put in the vaccines. I try to tell her otherwise and show them credible information but nope. Oh, I put the magnet to my shot location and I'm sure nobody will be surprised that... It didn't stick. I told her and she said \"It will. Do it everyday.\" I can't even.",

So far I've just found some anecdotes from folks who have done it. I know there are instances of people in Europe mixing <ORG> (similar to JnJ) with their second dose being either <ORG> or <ORG> and in Canada loads of people are mixing and have mixed <ORG> and <ORG>. I also read that there won't be studies about mixing vaccines for a long time. I have talked to a doctor and an epidemiologist. The doctor said go for it it's fine and the epidemiologist said there isn't guidance from the CDC and they don't recommend it. I have been exceptionally worried about getting covid as I live with 5 other people and have many types of anxiety including health anxiety. I really don't want to catch a virus that affects my breathing as it would trigger panic attacks for me. It's been almost 6 months since I got JnJ and I know the efficacy is waning. With all that being said, I know users on Reddit probably shouldn't recommend anything like this, but I am mostly hoping to find some anecdotes of people that have tried mixing and what their experience was like. Even some theories about mixing the different vaccines would help me feel better too. I'm at a point where I'm more worried about the outcome of catching covid without much help from the vaccine I got rather than what would happen if I got a different type of vaccine 6 months later.",

His concern is less about any side effects or any conspiracy, and more along the lines that it is not necessary and should not be be mandated on individuals. His view is that for his age group (30-40), the risks from Covid are negligible and not worse than an ordinary flu. I would like to show him scientific accredited research disproving his position. It does not need to be a scientific paper, but at least a view that is accredited to a recognized bona fide source. In particular I would like to prove the following (all specific to his age group): 1) There is a materially higher risk of contracting Covid than the flu. 2) There is materially higher risk of an adverse health effect (eg significant, versus an unpleasant cold or flu) from Covid than the flu. 3) There is a materially higher risk of being a host and thereby transmitting to a third party Covid by being unvaccinated.

I don't feel bad for her especially since she is GUILT free for continuing to go into public maskless and Covid positive. And I resent her deeply for putting her son and myself in such an uncomfortable position.

I didn't know the symptoms from the second vaccine would be this rough for me. I was out of the house from 9am-5pm (and didn't sleep well that night either). I couldn't sit still in classes and writing was so difficult because I had no strength in me. Wearing a mask made more heat build up around my face and head, causing more pressure. I took so much tylenol (2 tablets every four hours) because my fever kept coming back every hour and it was so bad that I felt like I was going to pass out but kept pushing through. My appetite decreased immensely because of the fevers (102F) so I ate less than 500 calories for the past two days. Driving back home was a hassle because I couldn't even completely push down on the gas and brakes, I was drained and aching. My entire body felt like there were sharp needles jabbing at my skin. Taking a mere step was just agonizing. Finally, I got to rest when I came home but still feel bleh today as well and am currently in bed. Probably slept 18 hours total. My symptoms were worse because my body got no rest and I also didn't sleep well the night I got my vaccine (which was monday evening). People were informing me it wasn't that bad for them and that I should just get the second shot, but I shouldn't have listened! Everyone's body reacts differently. Anyways, moral of this - please rest and take the second vaccine on your days off just in case if you haven't yet, don't suffer like me. Other than that, WOO-HOO I'M FULLY VACCINATED!",

I dont feel sick and I'm vaccinated (got my second dose on the 27th) but it feels like just a matter of time until I keel over. I don't know who to talk to or what to do. I just feel like this is it.

After I got the second coronavirus vaccine(<ORG>) on the 19th of June I started to have strong heart palpitations and trouble breathing for a day and a half. That all subsided but later after 13-14 days I started to get the same symptoms that persisted for 5 days. My EKG test was also abnormal when I decided to test it and I'm going to go visit a cardiologist around October. I quickly got brain fog minutes after having the same symptoms on the 2nd of August.

At the time I had my first dose of <ORG> 4 weeks prior, and had my 2nd dose 2 days after exposure. I got a PCR test 5 days after exposure and it came back negative. At the time I kinda had a weird throat, almost like a lump in my throat, but I don't know if I was making myself sick from all the anxiety. Anyway, I need to get a day 13 test on Monday to get out of quarantine and I'm so worried that I'm going to be positive. What are the chances of a day 5 negative test that turns out to be positive on day 13? It seems delta has a really short incubation period, so it would be unlucky? The only other symptom I have is like some excess mucus in my throat which is causing a tiny sniffle in my nose every now and then. I live with my parents who are fully vaccinated and they have not shown any symptoms.",

No offense to those with friends &amp; family who are Covid deniers, but when you are married to one of these, it is on a whole other level. Does anyone in my situation agree? It is one thing to deal with essentially extended family &amp; friends in this situation,...the answer is simple....don't talk to them! I have cut those ones out no problem and with no regrets. Our lives are hopefully not enmeshed with those relations. It is completely different when you are married to them. It is basically on the level of destroying your life. You are damned if you do and damned if you don't. There are hard decisions to be made. Or are we dealing with mental illness and should stay? May I ask, if you are in my situation, how have you navigated this with your spouse and what, if anything, have you done or plan to do with your marriage?",

I had the people of Hawaii not wanting us in the back of my mind throughout the trip, and I still feel some guilt for going. I get back from the trip about 4 days ago. I live with my parents and thought it would be smart to do a soft-quarantine away from them (i.e. generally stay in my room and wear a mask around them if i do have to interact). I'm getting tested tomorrow. I know that I'm probably being way too careful than most people would. I learn that my friend is on her way to Seattle on an impromptu trip. Not even a week after we return from Hawaii. She didn't care that she might be spreading the virus around. why do I care and still continue to lose out on valuable experiences?

Just be considerate if you find you have been around someone who has tested positive. Get tested around 3-5 days after exposure and before getting a neg test wear a mask if you have to be around people you dont know their medical history or vaccination status.

He works out at least 3-4 times a week, and eats well. Hes expecting a baby soon, actually. I love my older brother he is my rock, and has been my paternal figure for as long as I can remember. He was admitted yesterday morning because his oxygen was at 85% and he became unresponsive. The sad part is that he contracted it from his own kids &lt; age 10 (who didnt know they tested positive at the time). Now, he has developed double pneumonia. I know that his oxygen levels are in the upper nineties, but its still incredibly scary to know that it can go downhill at any moment. It hurts to see him so weak, and I feel so helpless. The stories on the news do not help, either. When I see people online say they deserve it for not being vaccinated, natural selection, etc., it just feels so dehumanizing to me. These people are human beings, with families and kids. Has anyone else had a similar experience where theyve had a (relatively young) family member in the hospital due to COVID complications?",

He is the sort to refuse the vaccine and say covid is not real. He is 58, diabetic (uncontrolled, he went in with blood sugars at 33, now controlled by hospital and down to 15) He is now at the stage they want to do intubation, as his oxygen levels are low and not recovering via other methods. However he is eating and able to talk but gets very short of breath. He's refused so far and we as the family know it is due to the posts and stuff he has read about the drs wanting to kill patients etc etc. The drs are unwilling to talk to him about the treatment and the pros/cons as they dont want to mess him up mentally. As the family we have been asked to talk to him, however I am getting rather emotional and angry that he's refused. I just don't know what we can say to him that would help him understand his situation and that if he does refuse his chances of leaving the hospital are reduced without the treatment.",

My mother recently had a fairly major surgery over a month ago and is in recovery and I'm her care giver at the same small apartment. We both are fully vaccinated. Today, we were Covid tested after learning my older brother and his son tested positive. &amp;#x200B; My mother tested positive and I did not, despite being in close proximity with her pretty much all the time. She's had light symptoms for about 5 days. Runny nose, sore throat, cough. No apparent breathing issues at this time. I'm worried because she also is immunocompromised in addition to being in surgery recovery. &amp;#x200B; Then there's my situation. I can't really effectively quarantine, and we're in a small space. I suppose I just have to hope I don't get it somehow. &amp;#x200B; Are there any small things I can do, supplements, vitamins, OTCs that can safely help her recover?",

He was over-weight (not obese), diabetic, and has had asthma most of his life. His underlying health conditions placed him at higher risk for complications and I am sure that he was aware of this and yet, he did not get the vaccine. I was floored when I learned that he was unvaccinated because to me it was a no-brainer type decision. The last time we spoke I asked if he was vaccinated and he said \"I wish had.\" He was happier and more hopeful in the last two years than he has ever been and was engaged with a wedding date in the spring of 2022. He made his last car payment on the same day that he tested positive. He always came across as so intelligent and confident. However, after getting sick and fearing that he was going to die, sounded so scared and defeated. Last weekend he crashed and was placed on a vent. He continued to crash, went into multi-organ failure, began to bleed out, and became septic. At that point I knew that if he survived that he would be in such horrible condition that he would have no quality of life. I am relieved, given the circumstances, that he died. But he suffered so much over the last 34 days that I would not wish it on anyone. If you have something to live for get vaccinated! Trusting your immune system or thinking that you can get through it is foolish. Don't throw everything that you love away.",

After doing research, I realized that lots of people have had similar problems &amp; worse (heart inflammation, etc). Eventually, I got really anxious and didnt end up getting my second dose. Even though I mask up when I do go out and social distance as much as possible, I still fear that Ill catch covid. Since the delta variant lowers the efficacy of the vaccines, I can imagine how much less protection I have being partially vaccinated. I fear for not only myself, but my mother &amp; other family members. Most of my friends are not vaccinated &amp; are also skeptical of the vaccine. One of my friends sisters has gotten 2 doses &amp; she developed myocarditis and experienced issues with her period. I know not everyone will have the same experience, but whos to say who will and who wont ? Covid isnt any better either. Lots of people made me feel crazy for getting the vaccine; I was super excited to get it but now Im terrified. Has anyone gone through the same thing?

This pandemic having no end in sight, people dying left and right, the constant fear mongering, life being so dull and the future uncertain... its all too much.

I hate wearing masks. I hate having to social distance. I hate not being able to do anything. Almost 2 years of reliving the same day over and over again....",

I don't expect people to mask up one on one or in manageable groups. But I guess, whenever I'm in a large group setting, I'm always surprised and anxious when I see so many unmasked faces. And I get it, after being told we could take them off after being vaccinated, its soul crushing to hear its 'strongly suggested' we wear masks again due to Delta.

I'm not sure if what I said got through to her, or if she's doing it to keep her job now, but either way I'm happy. I did end up making a page for her, and I went down the line of articles she sent me pointing out the faults of what some of these antivaxxers were saying (it was easy to find that these people were only out for money). I also showed her the nursing reddit and I think that shocked her a bit maybe? So I'm really happy about that, and I hope she'll be healthy as she gets her 1st and 2nd shot. I keep reading stories of teachers literally dying from this strain, and it worries me that she might not make it until the first jab. :( I'm honestly hoping that our governor makes school online for the time being. Oregon hospitals are being filled up right now, and last I read the ones in Portland are renting morgue trucks for the bodies... Aside from that, my life has been a rollercoaster on a personal level. I got my fiance visa to get married in the UK to be with my partner, but our plans for him to come help me have been thrown out the window (due to UK visitors not being allowed entry into the US), and now I have to do everything on my own. It's super daunting. It's such a strange time right now. Good news that seems to somehow bring around worry just as well. I always try to look on the bright side of things, so even if I have to move everything out on my own, then it's one more challenge on myself to improve! And in the end it's a start of a new life! Each hurdle makes you stronger, and I need it for my future plans so I can succeed. :)",

Come to think of it, I don't personally know anyone who was admitted overnight for covid and came back. So please, could I have some stories of people who did recover after being on a ventilator? What was it like? Details are helpful. I'm looking for vivid narratives to combat this storyline in my mind. Some tangible reason for hope. Please. Thank you.",

Some of the things he said concern me and Im just not sure what to make of them as I feel some of his statements seem to be conflicting. Below are the excerpts from his letter that concerned me or that I found conflicting. . . . [w]e are seeing more cases among our students than we did last year. Fortunately, because all of our students are wearing masks in schools, we are not seeing a high rate of spread in the classroom. . . . While your child may not be quarantined when there is a positive case in their classroom, you should be aware that there are likely positive cases in your childs school. Please check your child every day for symptoms . . . . . . As I told you at the start of the school year, our goal is to keep students in school as many days as possible this year . . . My youngest son currently has an upper respiratory infection but tested negative for COVID. My oldest son contracted Hand Foot &amp; Mouth Disease last week, most likely from another child at school (he is well now). While Im thankful theres a mask mandate in our district, Im still concerned that my children are most likely attending school with other children who have COVID-19 and might contract it, especially since they arent eligible to receive the vaccine. Am I worrying too much or is my anxiety justified?",

Right now I've lost almost all of my close friends except 1, and so far I haven't gotten very far in finding new close friends and the group I used too hang out with is very covid cautious, and still doesn't even want too hang out outside. With one of my close friends I thought the vaccine would bring us closer and stop her from judging me for enjoying normal life but instead it just tore us apart even further. She recently got mad at me for planning on going too a concert this November in Florida. And economicly work is slowing down a little again because of the delta variant, and I had too move back in with my mom because I had my car broken into twice and totalled 2 times in 4 months. And I really have no hope things will get better, I don't think I'll ever be able too find new close friends again and we're gonna have too wear masks for a very long time again.

I got my first <ORG> shot and cant begin to describe the freedom and relief its given me so far :) The thing is, most people here disagree with me and some of the things people are saying are disturbing, and have caused me great sadness and anxiety. The most difficult thing to hear from antivaxxers and COVID deniers is to let it take its course, the strong will survive, and to let it depopulate a crowded planet. Im studying farming and human health is deeply interwoven in agriculture. Im well aware of the dangers of overpopulation, especially what this will mean for future generations, but still want to protect to protect my fellow people. I think about the millions who have died, young and old, healthy and at risk, and it breaks my heart. Im the only one isolating in my farm program (until my 2nd shot), delta has made it here to this small unvaccinated town, and dont have anyone to talk to about my fears. My co-workers aunt died of COVID, yet he is still antivaxx and blames it on her being overweight and weak. Its just a cold he says, the strong will survive, youre tough right? I have a compromised lung and am terrified of what it might do to me. To hear let the strong live from such a tight knit hippie community just doesnt make any sense. I feel so alone you guys, and cant wrap my head around my peers being okay with the weak dying off. Please help me regain my faith back in humanity. Sending love to you all &lt;3",

Baby is now 6 months old, and with Delta, weve restricted our bubble to grandparents (also our childcare) only. My office has us on a hybrid WFH model 3 days in office, 2 days remote. Only unvaccinated people are required to wear masks in the office at all times (we had to provide proof of vax cards), but I still mask when moving around the building. Work protocols encourage all digital meetings, but allow in-person conferences with social distancing. So far Ive been able to avoid any in-person meetings, except this one Im required to attend an off-site meeting with members of my office + members of a new agency partner. Its a small gathering at the agencys office 7 people and my team members are vaccinated, but Ill be the only person wearing a mask (the agency said they arent masking in-office. No insight on their office protocols). The meeting will last 2 hours. Not sure how big the conference room is. The agency is providing coffee and breakfast treats (my favorite things) of which I will not partake. I plan to mask the entire time, have as much distance between myself and others as possible, and drive right back home to shower. I guess Im just frustrated by the requirement to attend the meeting in-person AND feeling like Im being overly paranoid. Delta is rampant and I have an infant. Im not going out to do anything fun in general, groceries are delivered, and I resent having to be around people whose vaccine status is unknown to me. I suppose my question isam I worrying too much?

She will be quarantined in her bedroom and bathroom for the next several days. The rest of the family is negative and symptom free (so far) so she's going to be fairly isolated. To help her pass the time, I'd like to give her a fairly easy and affordable fun surprise each day. Some ideas are: *fancy fun food on a fancy tray outside her door *outdoor lounge area with blankets and pillows for a day *online shopping spree (with a $ limit) *new art supplies *new makeup/sheet masks *let her rent a new release movie or tv series to stream in her room I'm looking for other ideas and suggestions.

I could afford to quit for a while until I find work, so that's also an option, but I've never collected unemployment (not that I want to!) in my 2+ decades of working. Advice? Thoughts? What to say to the boss? I contacted HR and they are working on \"forms\" for people with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe disease, but those won't be ready and I won't have them complete by my doctor by Monday. Should I call in sick the days I'm supposed to be at work? Or take time off? So lost and incredibly stressed out. I was notified the third week of August we would return to office unless covid doesn't improve - and it hasn't - so I wasn't worried but he's serious he wants us back in the office during this surge.",

I got the ticket in May when stuff was looking better pre Delta, going for general admission since it was cheaper. I'm fully vaccinated (<ORG>) and tested once a week, not high risk, and everyone was required to show proof of vaccination or a negative covid test, and wear masks except to drink (and everyone actually followed it around me-there weren't many people drinking and the people that were quickly put their mask back on after), and the state I live in is doing alright at the moment. The band I saw isn't incredibly fast-paced so not everyone was screaming and singing the whole time, and it was a fairly small concert. Because of these factors, I assumed it was safe enough before the concert, but stupidly forgot I had general admission tickets. My friend and I stood near the back but soon people filled in behind us and we were surrounded by a crowd of people. I couldn't stop worrying the whole time but given all of these reasons it wasn't enough to waste my money and make my friend leave (who is also fully vaccinated and didn't seem as concerned by the situation). Given all of this, would you say this was a high risk situation or am I most likely okay (obviously I acknowledge there's no way this was 100% safe)? I've seen so many conflicting sources on the severity of the Delta variant and the duration of vaccine protection (some feeling it's only a bit less safe than it was in May for vaccinated people, others ready to go back to barely seeing people) that I can't tell if this is just slightly over-the-top anxiety after not being in a crowd for a year and a half or if going to this concert was a legitimately dumb/selfish thing to do. I'm going to get tested on Monday anyway but I'm just not sure if I should be avoiding people before that.",

At this point I see no hope for the future. It seems like the life I used to know will never come back and from now on I will be confined to living through a screen for the rest of my life. I can't go on like this any longer. Everyone says that this will end some day and that no pandemic lasts forever, but when exactly is this going to end? Last year we thought things would be back to normal around summer/fall of this year, then now we say 2022. The goalposts keep moving, how am I supposed to trust that we will actually be able to come out of this pandemic and get back normality again? As an extrovert, not being able to interact with people and socialize on a regular basis has completely destroyed my mental health. I feel so empty inside and I'm not sure what I'm living for. If the vaccines no longer work, then what is our next strategy? Are we just going to keep ourselves shut-in for an indefinite period of time?",

He wears a KN95 while here and I tried to keep my distance, but we chatted for about 10 minutes, and he did give me a hug (while holding his breath). I don't know how well the KN95 was fitted since he has a larger nose and that sometimes creates gaps.

        "Reddit Post": "So in recent days, theres been a bunch of posts from my universitys subreddit calling for mandatory testing regardless of vaccination status. For context, my university has a vaccine mandate where ~99% are vaccinated, and a mask requirement. Now some students are calling for mandatory testing as well. They want transparency regarding the covid situation at my school. However, a point Ive often heard is that the vaccine does not prevent infection. It does, however, work to keep you from getting sick, so cases may not be the best metric post-vaccination. Now this may be different for places with low vaccine uptake, but my state has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. Yet, these students defend their arguments by saying they dont want to spread it to their family, and even with a vaccine, if you could avoid the virus by staying home, then why not stay home. With all this in mind, Im afraid that if we get mandatory testing, people will freak out by seeing a high raw case number (and forget that the point of the vaccine is not to prevent infection), and go remote. I guess they do have a point to some extent. Given the situation of covid rn with the Delta variant, and hospitals in some states overwhelmed, theres still a need for vigilance. But I just feel like theyre completely overlooking the point of the vaccine here, and acting like its March 2020 again. I know that youre largely safe post-vaccination, and you always have to accept a certain level of risk in your life, and even with Delta, the vaccinated are still largely protected. Maybe theyre just a vocal minority, but Im afraid the administration takes their word and puts all of us back online. I just want to add - I know this post could make me come off as anti-restrictions at first, but Ive been following the restrictions since the virus hit and got the vaccine at the earliest opportunity, and Im 100% supportive of vaccine mandates to get us back to normal. But its just getting to me how these people are acting like its March 2020 all over again. Granted Reddit is often not reflective of the average persons opinion, but if you guys have any support, Id love to hear it",

Lately the weather has been crappy and coworkers are always sniffling and clearing throat and it drives me insane but i always assume is allergies. Today a coworker was blowing her nose on a tissue and then i hear out CEO tell her to feel better. I had talked to her for less than a minute and more than 6 feet apart both masked but on an enclosed location. I am trying to not freak out here. My company is very strict with covid regulations. We have a mask mandate, most people work remotely or are spaced out in cubicles. My guess is if the boss told her to feel better is because he knows she doesnt have covid right? Also my interaction wouldnt count as exposure, would it? i am continously losing my mind, if this thing is not over soon i am gonna go crazy",

I want to be there to cheer him on and support him on such a happy day like he was for me, but I am so scared of getting covid. With the health issues I have I could easily end up very sick despite being fully vaccinated. I don't think I would die, but I know I would probably struggle a lot. I struggle with my health and ability to work on a daily basis so getting covid could possibly take away my ability to earn an income for a while too so that's a major concern. I'm also a little disappointed that they aren't taking more precautions for the event. Only encouraging masks for those who want to wear them. To be honest, I'd probably go if it were socially distanced and with proof of vaccine or negative test and masks required, but that's not how it's being done. Those things may be annoying but it's just such an easy thing to do. The day is absolutely not about me, but I'm heartbroken that I most likely won't be able to be there for it. He understood when I explained my hesitancy and told me he knows I need to do what I gotta do. I didn't rsvp no because part of me wants to go if I get my booster prior to the event. My doctor suggested 6 months for that and the timing would line up for October. I just don't know what to do I'm so torn.",

Anyways, I predict that after Covid ravages the unvaccinated in the more unvaccinated parts of the Southern US and as we approach winter, Covid will move more north.. However, north eastern states from Pennsylvania, to New York, to New England as well as Oregon and Minnesota will be more prepared due to having larger vaccinated populations and Delta will have a minimal impact on the vaccinated there. The midwestern states like the Dakotas, Montana, and Wyoming have to more to worry about due to larger unvaccinated populations. After it works it's way through them than it appears that Covid really will end in 2022.",

(22F) I started a new job a few months ago in a small office (3-5 people) all whom are fully vaxxd. We dont wear masks but regardless I keep my distance as best as I can. Luckily we all have separate offices as well, however, there are times where we have team meetings at a conference table or so and so will come to my office etc to show me something (not always 6ft apart) Ive let go more with being so anal about things, but still keep my guard up. Long story short: my boss JUST came back from a crowded trip and sounds kinda stuffy and my coworker is traveling for a wedding today into next week. This makes my nerves skyrocket. I can avoid them as best as I can but if I feel more uncomfortable I want to politely voice my concerns politely as to not insult them. (I feel they will reject wearing masks and just stay far away) because last time they both traveled I felt like my concerns were laughed off. My birthday is coming up and I dont want to risk anything and my anxiety is making it hard to focus on work. Any suggestions how to bring this up to them? Possible solutions? Thank you so much!",

For almost 8-9 months my tests were coming back positive, but this time it did not. At the same time there was talk about immunity decreasing overtime, so since I had been vaccinated early on I figured it was because of that. To make sure the tests were not defective I tested my sister, who was vaccinated in late January, shortly after I did, and to my surprise, she was also negative (we both got <ORG>.) I then tested my niece who was vaccinated in June, and to my surprise, she was positive (also <ORG>.) Ater this, I decided to get vaccinated, again. However, Walmart denied me another <ORG> shot, so I went to the CVS, I lied, and told them it was my first shot, and got a <ORG> shot instead. I am feeling guilty for this, and I was nervous, but my god were the side effects intense. My fever was higher than my second <ORG> shot, and I had a swollen lymph node underneath my pit, and I was bed-bound for 48 hours. But today I took the test again, and within 2 mins of starting the test, I got a positive reading. Whatever this third shot did, it seems to have supercharged my immune system. However, I would suggest everyone wait for guidance by the FDA. I am in a very weird spot since I took an unapproved third shot. My electronic record card from the state of California does surprisingly have my third <ORG> shot in my record.",

I live in the northeast, and for many states here, the case decline is still nowhere in sight. In NJ, where I live, every day the 7 day average increases from a week before, and out rt is above 1 again after barely falling below 1 a few days ago. Many states already have declining cases, but granted a lot of those were states that were really hit hard by this wave. I know this wave cant last forever, but it just seems like week after week, this wave is getting more and more fuel here. And with winter being so close, I really hope it doesnt set us up for another rough winter, even if its not as bad as the last",

Everyone old enough was immunized, but this was a family trip and lots of kids. 4 adults, 7 kids represented three households not normally podded together. It was 95% outside and the kids really benefited from the social experience and exercise. We did all sleep inside a rented cabin. It was a great weekend. The day after we got home, one of the immunized adults had a slight cough and tested positive. No idea where they got it. Symptoms lasted about one day, now they're cooped up at home bored, though they've lost their sense of smell. So everyone else got tested and so far everyone (including the kids) is negative (we do intend to test again in a few more days). They said they've had common colds that felt twenty times worse.

To begin with everyone in this has been vaccinated for some time vaccinated. My best friend's father in law is quite elderly and due to a fall ended up in a hospital then a rehab clinic. In the rehab clinic he tested positive for Covid. He was sent back to the hospital, were they diagnosed him with pneumonia as well. Long story short, after a week and a half the hospital called and told the family to come say goodbye. They did. They were all required to wear full head to toe protective gear. I happened to be in the area and gave my best friend, and her mother in law a ride home. We all wore masks, and again, we are all vaccinated. I scheduled two tests for 5 days out from the drive. I'm told by some continue to go about your business while wearing a mask. Others say stay at home until you get back your test results. What is the correct answer? Where can I find CDC/WHO guidelines for vaccinated folks around Covid.",

I'm 68 years old and increasingly concerned about a couple of things: * Crickets from J&amp;J on a booster, not even periodic updates, just radio silence. Originally it was supposed to be a two-shot vaccine, but they got FDA EUA for the one shot vaccine, and its efficacy is lower than <ORG> and <ORG>. They may be farther out from market ready than I feel comfortable waiting. * I've reverted back to pre-vaccine protocols: masking inside, sometimes outside, and social distancing. I know all this got me through a year of COVID pandemic before I even got vaccinated. But, I still worry especially with my age and co-morbidities. I'm seriously thinking about going for a <ORG> two shot, basically treating my J &amp; J vaccine as if I've not had one (or it's a yearly thing), since I'm 6 months out. Those of you who have had J&amp;J vaccines and not had COVID, what are your thoughts about this? Has anyone gotten a repeat vaccine of any brand? Are you thinking about it? Is this crazy talk?",

We think that I had it before because I had been sick earlier in the year and was exposed to COVID during months of November. Nothing confirmed though. Where I live we have restrictions to just immediate households members with single individuals being able to meet with one household under 5 people and only that household. My roommates do not follow this at all and constantly have people over. I told them Im not 100% comfortable and we compromised to having one single person a day over because they NEED to see their girlfriends. Last night I came home from work and my roommates both had their girlfriends, not at the same time but still within the same day. My anger got the best of me and I freaked out on them. My roommate said that we need to have a discussion because our definitions of one person over a day arent the same. I admit that I lost my temper but I need someone to tell me that Im not being unreasonable. The look I was given by my one roommate when I told him I wasnt comfortable with people in the house was so invalidating. I havent seen my family and friends in months and theyre bringing people over because we got immunity. I feel like Im going insane here.",

At this point they are still dying in droves and enough of them remain unvaxxed to keep our hospitals clogged and it doesn't seem to be letting up. How can a person look at all the available data and choose not to vaccinate? How can people see that people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s are dying and that not be enough to motivate them to get vaxxed? How can they not protect themselves and their children? I am just shocked and stunned at this level of idiocy. So many kids are being left without parents. People encourage their adult children or their parents to not vaccinate and then they watch them die, followed soon by their own deaths. Some families have lost multiple members. Not to mention the data coming out of hospitals. I just read that only about 1400 vaccinated people in the US have died of covid compared to 180,000 unvaxxed (since the vax became available). I mean, I understand that misinformation can be powerful but how can these people CONTINUE TO BE THIS STUPID after all we've seen in the last few months?",

Started coughing yesterday while cleaning and assumed it was my allergies acting up, took some Benadryl and went to bed, woke up with a sore throat &amp; runny nose. No fever, though. I've been sleeping for most of today. I have a COVID test booked for tomorrow morning. I'm hoping this is just worse allergies than usual or the Fall cold I usually get during back-to-school that I avoided last year, but I can't help but feel angry. I live in a small college town. I've been the annoying one skipping events and asking people \"will there be masks there?\" and getting mocked for it. Maybe I haven't been perfectly cautious, but I'm vaccinated and the past year of my life was the worst I've ever felt mentally. In some of my classes, I'm the only one wearing a mask. I have one class in a packed lecture hall with 100+ people and maybe 10 of those people bother to put a mask on. I'm not even sure how much wearing a mask protects me since I'm vaccinated. I'm just so tired. I don't know if anything I'm doing is right or wrong, nobody around me cares if their actions hurt others and some of them even actively joke about \"trying to get covid\" or things along that line. It feels like there's so much guilt around if you get COVID. Like, if you get it then it's your fault for not being a \"better person\" and making \"better choices.\" I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do anymore in terms of protecting myself and I'm lonely and sad and tired of being the killjoy people make fun of and it sucks so much going to a university where I can actually see how little my peers care about others.

Given this info, should I assume Im only 77% protected from hospitalization? Considering Ive been fully vaccinated since May. Now it would be a little over 4 months since I was fully vaccinated.

With that said I still can't hide my utter disgust and contempt for the media for their complete muddling of the message with the vaccines and leaving some people still in the dark. I just had my doctor's appointment today, besides needing to lose a few pounds again (I'm at the gym on most days trying to stay fit), he found no health issues with me whatsoever. Normal blood pressure, normal oxygen levels, I am still considered overweight though (I'm vaxed since April). Still not obese like I was in early 2020 at over 220 pounds. Still at around 190. I asked my primary doctor if he recommends I get an MRNA dose since I was only vaccinated with J and J back in early April. He said it's not necessary right now and I would be notified if anything changed. I kind of wish he said I should or that he said \"I'm not going to stop you but it's not necessary right now.\" I guess part of this frustration just comes from the mixed messaging we are getting from the media. God the media is just such scum in America, I know its horrible to say that but they just give terrible messaging. It's either, \"Covid is a hoax or the Vaccine doesn't work sheeple\" or it's \"We're all going to die\". Leaving that all aside, I wish we had more data on J and J in regard to Delta. It sucks because in early October I am going on a trip with two friends to Florida and they are all vaxed as well. We would be wearing masks on board regardless but still all this talk of the need of boosters and unclear answers from certain experts just leaves me more confused.",

There will probably be a maximum of 30 people there and everyone will be vaccinated.

I really want to go cuz Ive been isolated for the past year and a half cuz I lived with my parents and they never let me see my friends. Its pretty rare that I get to do something fun like this cuz there arent many in person events happening at my college. I also have CPTSD from being isolated and I know getting to talk to people and do normal things for once and I dont have to think about dying and how Im going to be alone forever will help my mental health a little which is something Ive been ignoring for the past year and a half cuz theres nothing I can do about it. My dad is still ok with me going but I cant eat and I have to stay far from people. At that point I might as well stay home. Also I dont even live with him cuz I live in college.",

I see one study concluding that PCR tests may miss 36% of infection cases in real-world scenarios ([[url] while other studies suggest much smaller fail rates ([[url] Is there any growing consensus on what exactly the rate of false negatives is? For context, I had my second dose of <ORG> mid-April. I stupidly visited my sick, unvaccinated family last weekend, and spent a decent amount of time with them. My father and sister have since both tested positive for COVID-19 (my sister with the PCR test, and I believe my father with the antigen test). I was first exposed to them on Wednesday, Sept 15, and my last exposure was Sunday, Sept 19. I exhibited symptoms on Monday, received a PCR test Tuesday morning (administered by a healthcare professional), and received a negative result today. The reasons I'm doubting it are (1) I spent 5 days with a bunch of unvaccinated, sick people, (2) I myself am now sick. My symptoms are those of a cold/sinusitis (e.g., sneezing, runny nose, headache, fatigue, pressure in ears, etc), but it seems those are also the symptoms of COVID in vaccinated individuals. My sense of taste is subdued (not gone), but I think that's possibly due to congestion rather than COVID. So I'm sort of torn as to whether I should trust my recent test result. Did I get tested too early? Do I get retested? Is it truly just more likely that I have a cold/sinusitis?",

My boyfriend has been against the pandemic from the very beginning. He was wearing masks up to a certain point but has even stopped doing that. He has been kicked out of a grocery store for not wearing a mask before in the past year and has state that he will not will a mask in order to get a job, he will not wear a mask in order to enter a building and he wont wear one in order to be there for the birth of my child. He feels like his rights are violated heavily and while I agree with him on how wrong things are, I dont think he should miss the birth of his child for it; its his first child and we are not having anymore kids. I already have a child with a previous partner and do not want to get pregnant a 3rd time. He does not want to get vaccinated which is his right but I believe the Hosptial we are giving birth at requires non vaccinated people to have a mask on at all times. (Vaccinated people do have to wear one as well but I do not have to wear one during childbirth if I come out negative for Covid + proof of vaccine) I told him that if he doesnt want to wear the mask to stay home and not cause anyone stress but he wants to be there. He just doesnt want to not be forced to wear a mask the entire time and will only leave if forced to leave. I dont know what to do because I believe in what hes saying but i dont understand why he cant be selfless about this if its for the birth of his child. Idk if its the right sub for this but what do I do if hes right in saying he has the right to do what he wants but he inevitably wont be able to support me by choosing to stay on his stance of things?",

It sort of worked out okay, because he had an office job that he went to 5 days a week so I had at least some space when I wasn't in class or working. Then covid hit, and he had to work from home indefinitely. Even after the vaccines. He literally does not go anywhere, he has no social life, so he was pretty much home 24/7 and I we would start butting heads more. He kept assuring me he'd go back eventually though. But a few months ago, he was laid off because the pandemic hit the company hard and they had to make a cut; they decided the cut was going to be him. So now there's no end in sight. I feel I have very little personal space and it's driving me insane. It's all the typical issues one may have when living with their parents as an adult, except the parent in question literally never leaves the house. Ever. On top of that, I've become the sole provider without warning, and I'm a part timer college student making MAYBE $1000 a month if I'm really lucky. I was planning on moving out with a couple friends, but I'm afraid of the guilt accompanying that now. My dad has tried and failed to reach an actual human being about getting his unemployment for months now- it's been an endless cycle of of applying &gt; not hearing anything &gt; checking status &gt; case has expired for some reason &gt; try to contact &gt; nobody is ever available &gt; try applying again. I've been trying to get back to the things I missed out on last year to cheer myself up, but it's really hard. Even if this all finally passes, that does nothing to help the financial and emotional situation. I tried looking into therapy, but surprise surprise, I can't afford it even with insurance.",

I'm a little confused about 'people at increased risk for severe illness' and the new category of 'people who are at high risk of professional exposure'. Have they just not defined these categories yet? Do we have any information on what those definitions will be? Will they be left up to the states like in the first role out? Because 'at increased risk' could mean a very small number, or it could mean anyone with any of the preexisting comorbidities from back in last winter (which was defined state by state). Are we looking at a narrow definition - like decreased lung function or previous heart attack - or a broad one, like high blood pressure and obesity? Or is there not enough information to say? The new category of professions - I'm sure that includes healthcare workers, but does it also include teachers? And i'm seeing both 6 months and 8... Again, I'm aware they might not have decided yet, but I've looked and I haven't been able to find anything on what these mean. Figured I'd ask. Thanks.",

So, they really wanted me to join a bowling league since I used to be in one with them a few years ago and I live in town with my grandparents (vaxxed) again. I reluctantly agreed, though didnt really want to because I still felt uncomfortable. But, with covid low at the time, I figured Id at least try to rejoin society. Then, delta hit, and has been ravaging my state pretty bad since it is a deeply antivax state. Since then, Ive been trying to act like everything is close to normal (though Ive been wearing my mask), and I even went to the first week of bowling. My grandparents are currently in the middle of a covid scare, though it looks like were all negative with some random bug. With me possibly getting an in person job, knowing Im a bit of a hypochondriac, and with me living with my grandparents, I dont really want to continue going to bowling with everyone else, but rather just by myself. The other members of the league are audibly anti-mask (I was the only one wearing a mask when I went), and its not a position I really want to put myself in at this point in time. I just know that my family is going to be really mad at me for wanting to bowl by myself and I feel kinda bad for backing out.",

After that the only long covid symptom that I noticed was lack of concentration. Then, I got covid again on June 21 and have since been experiencing severe anxiety. I had never struggled with anxiety before. I had only had my first attack in January of this year but I can trace the trigger to some relationship issues I was dealing with at the time. However, ever since I got covid this past June Ive been experiencing anxiety on a more constant level. I had a really bad attack at work to the point that a coworker of mine took me to the ER. It comes out of nowhere, I cant place any specific triggers. Im not anxious about getting covid again, so its not that. Yesterday I had a really bad day because for the first time I was anxious all day long. Ever since I ended up in the ER I take a clonazepam pill only when Im having an attack. I thankfully started therapy today because I know I need help. Has anyone experienced post covid/long covid anxiety like this? Meaning not necessarily because one is afraid of covid. It just simply happens. If so, what has helped you? How long has it been happening? Has it gone away for you? Thank you.",

We have been homeschooling because we did not think it was safe to send them back unvaccinated. &amp;#x200B; We have a babysitter who has had the J &amp; J vaccine, and she goes out with a boyfriend who she claimed was vaccinated, and visits him every night. Well it turns out that her boyfriend has only had one of the two shots (I think it was <ORG>), and she was also hanging out (unmasked) with the brother of the boyfriend who is completely unvaccinated and who tested positive for Covid on Tuesday (3 days ago). She had hung out with them for hours on both Sunday and Monday. Yesterday (Thursday) she went to get tested (nasal PCR test). Today, Friday, she received a negative test result from yesterday's test. &amp;#x200B; My thoughts are that I'm not sure about the accuracy of the test or if the incubation period has been long enough to develop a positive test result, or even if there is a likelihood of a breakthrough infection from being exposed to the unvaccinated Covid positive brother. The babysitter is eager to get back to work. Aside from the fact that I am pretty unhappy about her lack of masking, when would it theoretically be safe to let her come back and be with our unvaccinated kids? &amp;#x200B; Thank you for your input. If this is not allowed, please let me know and I'll take it down. I really did do at least 2 hours of research and am still not 100% sure what the correct answer is.",

He's been in quarantine for 13 days now since he first had symptoms. On the 2nd day after he tested positive, he got a monoclonal antibody infusion after which he had a high fever (39.5 C) for a day. His immune system is not very good and he has diabetes in case this is relevant. So he hasn't had a fever since then (under 37 C). He still has no appetite, coughs sometimes and is tired often. He took another test and still tested positive. CDC site says people with compromised immune systems may be infectious up to 20 days. Our city's tracing corps called and said after 10 days he can stop quarantine. But we are worried he can still be infectious. My question is, is there any test that he can take that can tell if he is still infectious and what does the science say about testing positive after a 14 day quarantine. How long could he be infectious? Thank you.",

She's the first one to bring the virus in our house from her school, my parents tested positive last Friday, I've been trying to isolate in my room while wearing a mask when outside my room and avoiding as much contact as possible. Long story short, this morning I woke up with a scratchy throat with some mucus buildup, did a rapid antigen test, showed positive within 10 minutes. I'm both anxious and disappointed at the same time. I know that we have the best protection we can currently get against this virus and that in theory we should be ok however I'm just afraid of brushing off this virus as a minor thing because loads of people have called this virus \"a bad cold\" or \"just the flu\" only to end up in hospitals or way worse you know? I'm disappointed because I build up this image in my head of the vaccine as a COVID shield that makes you really resistant to COVID and that it's super hard to get infected with it. I was even reading a case of a doctor who had the <ORG> vaccine who spent hours next to COVID patients and the doctor never got COVID. Now that I have it I feel extremely let down especially because I did try to take all the precautionary measure I possibly could. In the end I feel like having the vaccine made no difference to our family being infected because we got it anyways. Breakthrough cases are supposed to be 1 in 500, what are the odds of 3 of them in one household? Anyhow, my symptoms are just now starting, I have a very mild fever and my head feels kinda fuzzy but I expect them to get way worse in the coming days so I hope I don't have to be hospitalized that would be quite terrifying. I wanted to get this disappointment off my chest because I felt like sharing this with someone, thank you for reading and with some luck hopefully we will recover from this.",

My future FIL is immunocompromised from an autoimmune disease. When the vaccines came out, it seemed like that would have been the end of it. They suggested they were looking forward to coming after they got vaccinated. Then obviously the Delta spike happened. Well, I was completely expecting them to cancel before our RSVP date, which was 2 weeks ago. But they communicated to us that they were coming and were even offering to set up a rehearsal dinner for us. Well, today, they tell us they are still too scared, despite booster shots being available and covid cases trending down in most parts of the US. I am currently crying at work. My MIL/FIL and I had a wonderful relationship before all of this, but now I feel like I have to hide my true feelings. I am really upset. I know we all have our own thresholds for risk, but it is INFURIATING when we have data supporting returning back to pre-pandemic activities and vaccines and booster shots, and they are still scared? Why? I will admit, they expressed concerns about delta. But why not commit to saying no 2 months ago? Why wait til the last minute? It makes me feel like they will be absent in our lives for years to come because we moved out of state 2 years ago and it honestly feels like they are waiting for zero covid. Am I being a brideZilla here? How do I not hold a grudge against them for this? And lastly, is there any current evidence or metrics for immunocompromised folk that they should be following? Any advice would be helpful. DISCLAIMER: if you look at my post history, you will see I have health anxiety and generalized anxiety. I do not take meds for it. I have seen therapists in the past. My anxiety is mostly triggered by life events.",

I went to urgent care today with both a stuffed nose and coughing up mucus, thinking that he was just going to diagnose it as a cold.

I understand this is extremely risky since it's a close contact sports, so I'm just trying to weight my options here. I do not mind wear my mask when I play, so with that, do you guys have any recommendation on COVID protective masks for sports ? Do masks like these even exists? I was considering masks with valves and 5 layer filters, but all the comments said they don't really protect against COVID. What are your thoughts? Thanks!!",

For instance, I came home from work on the 7th and started sneezing and had bad congestion. The first thing that popped into my mind, Covid. So I do an at-home test, on the 13th negative, I kept sneezing so I do the second at-home test Wednesday negative. Still sneezing, went to the clinic that same day and got tested, negative. Still sneezing but now with a sore throat, I wait a few days and get tested that Friday, negative. It went away for a few days and came back and I ended up having a sneezing fit with a slight cough at night. Last Thursday I got a drive-thru PCR test because I haven't stopped sneezing. Got the results back, Sunday negative. Today, still sneezing with a runny nose. I had Covid in October of last year and my first symptom was sneezing. So ever since I've been soooo paranoid about getting it again. Especially since I live with immunocompromised people. I had a blood drawn allergy test earlier this month and it was negative for everything. I'm tired of every time this happens I start trying to play \"connect the dots\" to wonder if I've been exposed. I know those that are vaxxed will get \"mild\" symptoms and are less likely to be hospitalized or die or the long haul is cut by 50%. But I'm not seeing is any mention of is whether those who are vaxxed have any damage such as myocarditis or anything else that happens with those unvaxxed or if it exacerbates problems for those who got Covid a previous time.",

I went in there with her in the stroller and was petrified because it's indoors and yes there are masks but no one enforces this apparently. I was afraid of exposing her. She doesn't have the option of being masked or vaxxed. This little girl without a mask comes running over and the mom runs over and grabs her. I tell my fiance about it and she hears me. Basically, she refused to tell her child to put her mask on and wore her own below her nose. I told her that she isn't telling her child to put her mask on and she's not wearing hers right. I asked where is the compassion because my little one can't wear a mask or get vaxxed? Nothing. She ignored me. There was a three hour wait to be seen and we ended up leaving after this. Where's the compassion? I lost my grandfather to COVID while pregnant. I've watched my mother suffer now with not feeling safe outside, etc. I ended up bawling in the car. I just don't want to lose her and I know I won't but I can't help but feel so extremely protective of her. I gave birth in the epicenter. New Yorker here. I'm getting a booster on Monday. I'm a first time mom this is all very new to me and I'm trying. I don't know what else to say. I just don't know why it's so hard to be considerate.",

Since I'm really close to graduating, telling them to screw off isn't something I'd want to do, since I couldn't possibly afford my tuition on my own and I'm not fiending to go into debt if I don't HAVE to. I was pretty much told that my school would no longer be paid for, I'd be kicked out (I have to live with them as a stipulation of them paying for my school, otherwise I'd have dipped and this wouldn't be a problem) and they would remove me from the family health insurance plan if I got it. This was said AFTER I've already gotten the first <ORG> shot in secret because I just didn't want to hear the bs \"you're going to go infertile, you're a sheep, it's editing your DNA\" nonsense. I've heard the second <ORG> jab can knock you on your ass and considering the first shot hit me pretty hard (as in fever, nausea, chills, headache, etc), is there anything I can do to minimize the side effects? I feel like it might be too suspicious if I just *happen* to get \"sick\" about a month or so apart.",

Though I'd be able to wear it of the trip into the store was maybe 5-10 minutes. I was at a store longer than that once and for some reason I really started to hyperventilate and be stressed to the point it was hard to breathe with it on. Since then I've had to stay away from places that require them which really has taken a toll. I haven't been able to go to the Aquariam with my folks. Have had to cancel my trip to Disney. These trips were planned even after the vaccine came out. I ended up becoming so angry and resistant to everything about the pandemic because I honestly just felt like there was no accommodations for people who stress, anxiety or hyperventilate with a mask on. I ended up believing when people would say I was selfish for not wearing one. When in reality I just can't and its sad that I don't think people out there really understand why some people can't wear one.",

Unfortunately, due to the bungled vaccine rollout in our country as well as the Delta variant that reputation has been destroyed in 2021. We are currently at our absolute worst point since the pandemic started. Today we got 1435 cases, which I know if you're from America or Europe you might roll your eyes at us and think this number is tiny, but to us this is huge and unbelievably demoralising. We're poised to get out of lockdown around October 28th which is when we're predicted to hit 70% double dosed and we'll have more freedoms once we're 80% double dosed. But there is a huge fear of the hospitals being overrun here when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths skyrocketing and having to go back into lockdown even at high vaccination rates. I am feeling so defeated right now, although I am fully vaxxed so its some comfort to be protected. I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire. Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? Thanks.",

I couldnt tell if it was coming from inside the house I was walking by or what, so I kept walking straight, and soon the scent was very strong and I looked to my right and see a guy smoking on the back of his truck only about 6-7 feet away from me. Now Im freaking out that his smoke could transmit Covid to me because I definitely inhaled it. I had a mask with me but only put it on when theres people walking towards or near me, though most of the time theres nobody around. What are the chances cigarette smoke can infect me?

        "Reddit Post": "So last friday, my mom got a bit sick. We weren't really worried, since she has the best immune system out of all the family members, although she has been badly sick around 4-5 times ever since I'm alive, and I'm 20. To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications. Also, if anybody here had the same symptoms (burning stomach, burning chest or the headache without fever), please feel free to share any tips that helped you or helped someone else you know. Thank you!",

I have been exposed plenty of times both before vax and after and never caught it. I have had maybe 20 tests which have all been negative. My brother's wife got it and he still slept in the same bed with her and kissed her and he never got it. He was vaxxed with P plus a booster. Then I have 3 brothers that live at home still. One got it (unvaxxed) but no one else in the house did (everyone unvaxxed except my dad). I don't really get sick often anyways. I am young (24M) and take vitamin D and C everyday. I am starting to think that maybe people like me and certain members of my family may just not be susceptible to covid. I am pretty worried about getting it. The hospital sent out an email yesterday stating it is a matter of \"when\" we will get it not \"if\" (real reassuring). I am hoping I may be right about possibly being immune to it and that it won't come down to \"when\" I will get it. I would like to think I will not and I will certainly still try my best to make sure that I don't.",

She wore a mask at Thanksgiving and we just thought she was doing it because she wont get her vax. Well her 2 year old has a minor surgical procedure coming up and got a routine Covid test as part of the pre op. He tested positive, though is asymptomatic so far. Whats truly infuriating is that its obvious <PERSON> gave him COVID, and likely has given it to her other two toddlers, and yet she is STILL posting conspiracy theories on Facebook about how bad the vaccine is. My 80+ year old grandparents were at Thanksgiving, and she didnt bother telling anyone she was sick. Her kids didnt wear masks. Im infuriated. My mom burst into tears when she found out because she was so mad. The text she sent to notify family didnt even apologize, it just said her kid had tested positive and she hopes it doesnt affect anyone else Shes a registered nurse and Im genuinely considering reporting her to the county for spreading health misinformation. Im just so mad and upset and scared for my family.",

With the Oxford-<ORG> vaccine, I had a temperature of \\~39.7C for about two days and felt a bit crappy, but then by day four things were more-or-less back to normal. It wasn't particularly pleasant but I don't regret having the vaccine doses and continue to encourage friends and family. When it came time for the second dose, I knew what to expect. I'm now sitting at my PC rather terrified after receiving the <ORG> vaccine as a booster (I assumed it would be another Oxford dose) only a few hours ago, and have been trying to look at people's accounts of their first dose, but without much success (it seems a lot of it has been deleted). I've also looked at the piece of paper the nurse handed me, as well as the NHS, US CDC, and other reliable resources. It all seems very clinical which I usually prefer, but not in this instance. I'm hoping for some reassurance, kind words, and ... I'm not really sure. This subreddit seemed like a good place to post. I hope you're all well and look forward to replies. Thank you.",

Although Im glad to finally have that extra boost, the actual experience of getting the shot has left me feeling sort of anxious/upset for the rest of the day, and Id like some insight as to whether Im justified in feeling how I do? Basically, I noticed while getting my booster that the pharmacist administering the shot wasnt wearing gloves. She also kept touching/moving around the needle disposal bin, with her bare hands (which obviously had a lot of used needles inside of it) while giving me my shot. She also moved random furniture in the area around. Idkit just kind of grossed me out that after touching the used needle disposal container and furniture, that she gave me the shot and applied the band-aid? She was also kind of short with me. For example, she asked me if my left arm would work, but when I mentioned that Id rather do my right arm because Im left-handed, she made an exasperated sigh and angrily moved the furniture around so that Id be oriented correctly. This, combined with the fact that she didnt even bother wearing gloves and also kept freely touching the needle disposal bin before applying the band aid makes me wonder if she bothered to follow any health/safety protocols with me while giving me my shot. I have this irrational fear now that Ill HIV/AIDS through cross-contamination too. Anyways, Im wondering if theres anything I should do (like should I shower, go to the doctor, etc.)? Or if my feelings of annoyance and anxiety are justified here? Thanks!",

Tested negative on antigen on day 12 and negative again on a pcr on day 13. Ive done it; Ive beaten covid and at home to boot but today I had to return to work and I realize Im now scared of going outside. I was afraid of everyone not masking and coming over to talk to me. Im afraid Ill just catch this thing again and that itll be worse. Just now, I went to my local pharmacy to pick up some meds and essentials I needed; I was wearing a mask and my prescription glasses but this girl in front of me coughed a bit every now and then while checking out her purchase. I go over to the cashier and he tells me that girl was paying for a covid test to be done on site. I froze I was behind her and I used the same terminal as her; can i get covid again from this interaction? Im scared again and Im most sure Ill be able to go back to a new normal soon. Do you think I can catch covid again from my pharmacy experience? And also, how can I cope with being forced back to the office?",

However, my spouse only masks up indoor in public and is totally fine not masking at indoor family/friend gatherings. I think this is completely ridiculous and needlessly exposing them to infection (especially since a lot of said gatherings involve those who are not masking anywhere and have unvaccinated kids). Their view is that the social/emotional benefit of these gatherings (mainly because they would involve a shared meal) outweighs their risk of severe disease with a booster. Side note: My spouse is obese and has controlled diabetes. And I think they are making a big mistake. I have given up arguing the topic. I have just started telling them it is their choice, but I will not participate and will be masking around them at home until I know theyre in the clear. And I know masks cant prevent all infections. That is not the main point of my post. Im so frustrated.",

My biggest fear is that spring 2022 won't be normal at my university (e.g. most classes online, cancelled events, etc) and our administration has been more cautious than most other universities throughout this pandemic. The fact that we won't have more information on the variant for like two weeks just makes it so much worse... Anyways, after being able to get off reddit and avoid covid news for like two months, now my doomscrolling habits are back in full swing. I know it's a situation we can't control, but this just makes it so much worse for me, just sitting here waiting for some shitshow to happen. If things really get bad, I'm afraid it would also make me less optimistic about 2022/2023 as a year ago I remember experts saying by this time we should be pretty much done with this, yet here we are. I just really, really hope that spring 2022 does not turn out to be another semester of lost hopes at my university... Please, I just need some support today after what I've seen, especially that news of how fast cases are rising in South Africa. It's just so hard not knowing what the future will bring, and how this pandemic has gone on for so long with no end in sight, after our predictions on when we'll return to normal have been upended time and time again.",

But I'm also pretty nervous because the theaters are going to be crowded. I'm triple vaxxed now, so when the trailer came out, I told myself I would see this movie opening night no matter what the covid situation looked like. I'm an overly cautious person and I haven't had any fun at all this year. That was before the Omicron variant, which I know does not sound so bad right now, and we won't know for 2-ish weeks what the situation will be, but you know what's also in 2-ish weeks? Spiderman lol. I know I can always refund my ticket if the situation gets really bad, but if I'm boosted and wearing a KN95 mask, do I need to be so worried? I got a seat in the front-most row, so at least I wouldn't be boxed in completely. I know plenty of people go to the movies regularly now, but I also know some people who won't. I don't want to deny myself a fun experience and feel absolutely miserable at home but I also don't want to be stupid. The last time I tried to see a movie two months ago, I refunded the ticket and cried. I was so sad and unsure, I just want to go to the damn movies and have fun. I'm so sick of this. Before anyone suggests, I can't really just wait for a less full showing. I tried that with Black Widow and the theaters just filled up no matter what time I picked. All cinemas are only open now during peak times, so selections are limited, thus everyone packs into the same showing as you. I also live in densely populated LA. Empty theaters are impossible, especially with a movie like this.",

Currently I've had no luck finding the right group of people to hang out with post covid, a lot of the groups I used to go to are still online which are social support groups. And I don't do well with zoom calls. Moving isn't even an option for me because of how bad housing prices are everywhere and are only getting worse. And on top of that because of my mental health issues I can't do full time work and only gig work. Then we keep having new variants, maybe this one will turn out not to be a big deal also. Which in turn will make covid restrictions last longer and also the people I know will be less likely to approve of me doing things like going to concerts. And also it will make it even harder for me to get new friends. I don't think life will ever be the same as before the pandemic and it will be worse in many different ways post pandemic",

I am generally very cautious about covid for a variety of reasons but now mostly because my mother is undergoing brain surgery next week and I will be caring for her afterwards and Christmas is coming up where I will (hopefully) be seeing my grandparents and new babies in the family. My whole family is fully vaccinated and most are boostered. My boyfriend lives with his mother who is unvaccinated. I do not go over his house, he comes to mine which I've been okay with since I am not usually around anyone high-risk and he and I are both vaccinated and I have had the booster. He is trying to get an appointment but they are difficult to find. However, with the holidays coming up and my mom's situation I am very wary about even just seeing him before Christmas and it is making me very sad and anxious because I do not know what to do.

        "Reddit Post": "I live in Ohio, and things were good here but have been faltering for a while. My state is only 58.1% first-dosed and 53.1% fully vaccinated. It varies even more by county. Counties in and around big cities are more highly vaccinated. I still think these rates are terrible, and as other states get better, the gap becomes more obvious. My own county is doing only slightly worse than the whole state, but our hospitalizations are starting to get critical, and our cases are currently in a small uptick. Deaths remain fairly low, however, which is good. We have several very good hospital systems here, but the ICU usage is not falling as quickly as would be ideal. I have started getting really irritated at the flattening of our vaccinations here, and I'm not sure what I can personally do, if anything. I'm not anyone important. I am risk averse. My social media is basically all people who already believe COVID is real and take precautions and are vaccinated. Everyone is just trying to do the best they can, basically, but I don't see as much frustration among my friends and family. So, I ask, is there anything I can personally do? I'm not a scientist or medical professional. Is there an entity with whom I could donate or volunteer? I just sometimes feel like I'm shouting into the wind, but I really want to do SOMETHING that would help get our rates higher.",

Out in NYC they had an anime convention where a ton of people caught omicron and I feel like that could lead to cancelation of social gatherings again. Then just today in my county (Alameda county), health officials found at least 5 people with omicron after they went to a wedding. It doesn't seem like we will ever get past covid restrictions and that the more cautious people won't be willing to have social gatherings again. A lot of the people I connect well with are covid cautious, and one of them got mad at me for attending edc Orlando 3 weeks ago. I'm scared they won't be willing to have group activities with me anymore because of omicron",

I am sick of stressing myself out wondering if i will make it up to Scotland this year to see my family at Christmas, as i didn't last year. I had to cancel my Christmas last year as the UK went into a lockdown over-Christmas, and I will be dammed if the same thing happens again this year. Furthermore, I did have a look at the figures myself [[url] and deaths and hospitalizations are steadily falling which shows that the vaccines are working and that fills me with some confidence that we will have a normal Christmas this year, as going by the data there is no need for a lockdown AT THIS STAGE! After Christmas, they can do what they like! &amp;#x200B; One thing I hate about this Covid situation is how the media are reporting information. It's got to the point where I read the data myself and I don't bother watching the news or reading anything online. The media likes to focus on the high-case numbers here, but every-time they fail to mention that the deaths and hospitalizations have been falling for a number of weeks now. Part of me thinks they love to whip people up into a state of hysteria, even though at the moment there is no need. I get that people need to be informed about these things, I'm not at all suggesting people should just ignore what's happening, but I do think there needs to be better reporting from the media as they love the sensationalism of all this, at the end of the day they make money out of it don't they.",

I had covid in August, and swore that I would get my vaccine after I had fully recovered, but every time I go to book I panic and cancel it. I tried to book last month, but a family friend actually experienced the rare blood-clotting as a result of his vaccine, and it's freaked me out entirely. I may sound dramatic, but I am unfairly unlucky and have convinced myself that I will be the unlucky 1% to have an extreme reaction/die from getting vaccinated. I have encouraged all those around me to get vaccinated because I'm a strong advocate for it, but I'm so concerned that my lack of luck with health will put me in a situation where I won't have a positive experience. Has anyone else had this experience, or have any advice for me going forward? And please, spare me the 'stop being stupid' comments, as I've already told myself that multiple times lol",

I also have really bad needle phobia. For my 2nd dose the side effects were bad, but it was worth it to me because I could forgo wearing a mask and go to concerts and resteruants. The side effects I got were my arm was really sore, I had a bad headache and I just felt really sick after my 2nd dose. I'm also scared that we're gonna be forced to get boosters every 6 months and not even be a yearly shot. I don't think I'll be able to afford to skip work that often just to get the vaccine. In terms of health right now I'm pretty healthy and never get sick in general. So I don't personally think a booster is necessary for me. And there isn't really any reward for me doing so.",

I got a shot of <ORG> to mix things up a bit, and it was exactly two weeks from when I got the shot to when I was exposed to COVID. The shot itself I didnt even feel, and the symptoms I had the next day were fatigue, fever, and some body aches that I could treat with some Tylenol and rest. I was 100% back to normal the day after that! My boyfriend and I got exposed to COVID over thanksgiving from an unvaccinated family member. He hadnt qualified for a booster yet, and has been sick since Wednesday. A mild case for sure, but still symptomatic. We live in a tiny apartment and spend almost all of our time together. Since he got his booster the same day his symptoms started, we didnt realize it was COVID right away, so I wasnt distanced for a couple of days. Its been almost a full week that hes been symptomatic and I have consistently tested negative and have zero symptoms. Boosters work! Theyre important to getting everything under control.",

I don't mind because I don't go out often, but I feel it might be a bit... **much.** To be fair to my housemates, they have friends who are immunocompromised or have had a organ transplant. And another housemate caught the Delta variant after traveling but recovered after four days. Lastly, one of my housemates works in a place where they don't get days off if they get Covid-19... but I feel since we live in a high population of vaccinated people, we would be okay? Is there any news articles or studies that I can show them in order to calm down the frequency of testing? What do you all think?",

I kept wavering about it before, but the more I hear, the more I know I'm making the right decision. I told my husband that he is free to take the other members of our family, but my two year old and I will not be going. This trip would require 6 of us to be in a car together for 13+ hours each way, plus 4 of us would stay in a hotel (husband, me, 6 year old, and 2 year old) and 2 would stay with his parents (my stepkids - in high school and in college) for one week. Everyone else in my household besides the little one is vaccinated. The 6 year old will be fully vaccinated soon, and everyone else except high schooler will be boosted. My husband told me he cannot stop his son, the high schooler, from going to a party full of unmasked teenagers prior to our trip. Although I can control the actions of my little kids to help mitigate risk (like always wearing masks), I have no control over the older ones, so I'd be forcing my little kids to contract whatever their siblings have during the long drives. Even if it isn't Covid, any cold-like symptom will force us to reconsider our plans, so I'd rather just nix it now. Unfortunately, for the rest of them, it means that no one is going, since my husband doesn't want to make the drive himself. My husband and I have decided that we'll visit when the little one can get vaccinated and when the weather is nicer and we can do more outdoor activities with extended family.",

Through the weekend that got worse and on Sunday night (Nov 28th) is when the coughing started. I've had a pretty bad cough since then which has started to subside since this past Sunday (Dec 5th). I got tested on Monday (Nov 29th) and the result was negative but it was a rapid test which I know are inaccurate. I was not feeling any better on Thursday (Dec 2nd) so I decided to go into an urgent care thinking it was probably some kind of infection where they tested me for COVID again and it was positive. The nurse practitioner had given me a return to work date of today (Dec 7th), but I still decided to stay home since I woke up with a pretty bad coughing fit. The day has been pretty calm with a few small coughing fits here and there. I am seeking advice on when it would be safe to return to work, thank you everyone!",

I have pretty bad anxiety but have managed it pretty well this whole time despite some scares. Today I had a guy cough on me at work as I passed him in the hall way without him wearing a mask. Later that day I was squeezing past someone in a tight hall way because I was in a hurry and I felt them exhale on the back of my head, their breath smelled awful. They were wearing a mask, but I can not understand how I could have felt that gust of wind/smelt that if it was functioning properly. Later that day I was in a very large room and the person took of their mask to give a 15 minutes speech. I tend to stay home and never interact with anyone outside of my family. I allways wear my mask in public places. I read online that the <ORG> protects people from 2 to 8 months aside from having covid. I am hoping if I get positive that I can get monoclonal anti bodies again. I have heard in my state that cases are rising again, and I can see why because people do not take it very seriously in my culture. What do you think of my experiences today as far as exposure? thanks",

I texted my friend the good news and that I was excited to be able to see people again. She admitted that she is not planning to get her kids vaccinated and now Im second guessing myself. Shes always been a bit crunchier than me, but her kids have always gotten their shots before. I really want to start visiting with people, and the plan was to wait until our kid could get her shot then start slowly visiting people, but I had (very wrongly) assumed that those people would also be vaccinated. We live with my in-laws, both in their late 70s, who will not get vaccinated either. It feels like its just us in our little bubble and everyone else around is not getting their kids or selves vaccinated. Its hard to feel confident in the choice, ya know? If we did make a plan to visit my friend (both adults vaccinated but not their kids) would that be a huge risk? Do we risk bringing it home if we are vaccinated? I dont want to go another two years without seeing anyone; I dont know that my mental health could handle that. But how do you trade mental health for the potential of real, long lasting health issues from catching it? I appreciate any support. Thanks!",

I feel really afraid of my upcoming 10 day mandatory quarantine in a hotel for my trip. I'm not allowed to leave the room (not even for 30 minutes) due to government regulations and the police are watching, and the thought of staying in a room for 10 days really scares me. I'm a very outdoor person. Even in winter snowing I still managed to get out of the house to walk around during the previous lockdown in my country. Even during the first lockdown I get out of my apartment everyday just to get a fresh air, even if only for 15 minutes. I think another cause of my fear is because I'm afraid of giving up on temptation to snack and thus overeat. Anyone can give me a perspective on how I can see this quarantine from a more positive light? Or activities that can help me pass the time without thinking about food? I was thinking about working but my employer does not allow remote work from another country .",

I talked to her today and she wasnt planning on getting tested before traveling home as she recently got the booster, wears her mask and it isnt required to get tested before domestic travel. She will be getting tested 5 days after flying, but unfortunately for me, thats one day after we will get together. What are the chances she pass anything to me if she gets infected on her flight or before? Do we think/know the booster protects against transmission or most infection in the first place? I will be flying to another country a few days after we meet up and I dont want to risk testing positive before my flight but I also really dont want to be annoying and ask her to get tested because shes literally the most covid cautious person I know (before getting vaccinated she didnt leave her house for ANYTHING except when she was walking outside with a mask on).

While everything is opening back up and we got the vaccines, I thought everything will be back to normal this year, but I was wrong. This is the second worst year of my life. 2021 is bad as 2020. I hope 2022 be a better year, but it might be bad as well. The state I live on is in deep trouble. Cases rising, crimes rising, and even having a worst governor ever. This maybe the worst decade ever. I don't know if 2022 is going to be a better year. If the Omicron is mild, that better be true. Otherwise the news will refused to tell us the good news.

        "Reddit Post": "Age: 56, Female Weight: 60kg Duration of complaint: About 8 years (I think, can't remember exactly). We are Bangladeshis living in Bangladesh. My mother had osteoarthritis of the knees since about 8 years. She also has a bunion in one of her feet. Along with osteoarthritis she has osteopenia and pain in other joints. We checked for rheumatic markers but none were found. Anyways, all these osteopenia, osteaoarthritis of the knee, the pain with the other joints worsened gradually over time over the years. However the sharpest decline was in the 12 months after she had COVID-19. She had COVID-19 in October 2020. And the x-ray reports in March 2021 and December 2021 has seen very sharp worsening of the severity of the osteoarthritis of the knee. Doctors have also mentioned that the osteopenia and pain in other joints and the bunion seem to have worsened as well based on the symptoms. So my question is: Is this a coincidence? Or does COVID-19 indeed worsen, osteoarthritis, osteopenia and bunions? Second question: If COVID-19 does worsen these bone conditions, what's the underlying mechanism?",

Long story short, even after getting my vaccine I decided to not go out ever again if I can help it. COVID has made me a homebody and now I'm hearing I have to get a booster shot? I've told my family that there's no reason for me to go out mainly due to not only the pandemic, but also because I don't have a social life here. Personally I'm okay with not going out and I don't want to see other peoples' faces again if I can help it since I've been working remotely for the longest period of time.",

Seriously Ill help + comfort you any way I can. I just really want someone to be here after so much mental health damage",

They are full blown conspiracy theorists (no vaccinations, No distancing, etc). They got sick in September and thanks to monoclonal therapy they made it out okay. Partner and I have been fully-vaccinated since May and got boosted about two weeks ago. Even having been exposed we never got the virus (we tested about three times throughout). Weve been very careful but living close to them has broken me. They are dominant and a pain to live near by with (judgmental, super needing, very social and loud, among other things) I am from PR, where there is a great management of mask wearing and distancing, and a about a 88-90% (they keep updating data) of at least one dose of vaccination for total population. My whole family is fully vaccinated and I havent seen them in nearly two years because of this. Just before Omicron, I finally thought it safe to spend a good month home and take a break from this state and partners family (We have plans to move to a better place but finally impossible at the moment). Now with the new variant, this is causing huge cognitive dissonance and fear. I am just feeling so confused and torn for traveling, but I feel it will be better in the long run, but vacillate and think this is a mistake, but I want to get out of here. I am upset.",

My husband is vaxxed and hopefully getting boosted this week and our 14mo son is a very healthy toddler. We're planning to fly across the country in about 10 days to see my parents for Christmas and I have really been looking forward to it. My husband's brother is a pulmonary intensive care doctor at a hospital in MA, so he's been treating COVID right from the start. We were chatting with him last night and he told us there is a doctor in his hospital, at least double-vaxxed and only 59 years old, who has COVID and is on life support. I don't know anything else about this guy or his case (don't know about any comorbidities, don't even know if he was boosted) but this story really fucked me up and I can feel my anxiety spiking in a major way. Last night I convinced myself that if I got a breakthrough case I would almost definitely die and my son would grow up not even remembering his mom. I am a little more calm today but I need someone to finish talking me down and remind me how much of an extreme outlier this case probably is.",

The drive to increase booster roll-out is more to do with the increased number of cases and the fact that vaccine efficacy drops off over time anyway, not that omicron is 'evading' the current vaccines more than other variants. \\- The media will always jump to worst case scenarios because bad news sells more than good news.

Then if we arranged for a few days earlier we would need to get pre-depature PCR tests on Christmas Day itself which seems grim. If we went earlier, like next week, our boosters would not have kicked in. And there could be a lockdown or travel bans/quarantines coming in any day between now and when we would return. It is all round not a great idea with Omicron because me and my in-laws are all high risk. So we are going to cancel but I feel dreadfully guilty. I know they will be very disappointed although they'll understand. Also some of my colleagues are still going to the UK and I feel maybe we didn't try hard enough.

The groups I went to prepandemic are amoung the most covid cautious and even when things looked better still didn't want to return in person. I did try hanging out with another group that wasn't covid cautious and I didn't connect with them well. I wish my parents never decided to have kids so I don't have to live thru this horrible time. The new world is just gonna be way less social and everything from therapy to office work is just gonna be online. A lot of tech companies still don't want to return to the office and almost all therapists are the same.",

Im wanting to start doing jobs again, and got the opportunity to do a shoot for a clothing brand. Im honestly sort of worried though, because the shoot will be a few hours long, and I am supposed to have multiple people all up in my face doing my hair, makeup, styling me, etc. Even if the makeup artist and hair stylist wear masks, I obviously wont be able to wear anything on my face for obvious reasons. Im afraid that the people working on me can still transmit something to me (for example, if the makeup artist is really close to my face while applying my lipstick, Im not sure how safe Id be). Because I also live with family members, I worry that Ill also be endangering them. I wanna mention that pretty much all of us are triple-vaxxed, except for my teenage brother (who is only double-vaxxed due to his age). The idea is honestly freaking me out, even though I also really wanna get back into modeling. Given everything I mentioned, how safe am I?",

I got the booster shot back in late October (<ORG> x3). My entire family is boosted, and I live in CA where most of the people in my community are fully vaxxed/boosted. I have gotten back into socializing and even attending large events (for example, I went to a small indoor concert with about \\~100 people unmasked, but all of whom vaxxed in order to get in). I am very careful about where I go and who I have direct contact with, but have been relieved since most of the people close to me are boosted, let alone fully vaxxed. My issue is that I have a close friend (who lives/goes to school in AZ), who is **unvaccinated** and will not be getting it. She naturally got covid in late august of this year. It was bound to happen since she is basically clubbing/partying every night over there, and since there aren't any mask/vaccine mandates in AZ, most of everyone in her institution got it. She is visiting CA and wants for us to make plans for a new year's party together (with some of my friends here who are vaxxed/boosted). I am uncomfortable bringing her not only around myself, but around people who have taken precautions like I have to be safe (her reasons for not getting it are incredibly stupid and I don't want to get into it). I initially said yes (since I figured it's safe since I'm boosted), but I am having second thoughts now. This is because it's been 4 months since she got it naturally and studies show that natural immunity wanes quicker than the vaccines and transmission for unvaccinated individuals are much higher compares to vaccinated people. I understand that the risk for her to get sick again is higher than the risk of me getting sick, but it's not impossible. &amp;#x200B; What would you do if you were in my shoes?",

        "Reddit Post": "I attended a pop culture convention (Oz Comic-Con) last weekend in Melbourne of Victoria, Australia; at the time of the event, mask wearing was no longer enforced in those venues (indoors btw), only recommended, and all attendees needed a full vaccination to go. As I didn't wear a mask at all (but still had one on my person in case I was directed by staff/volunteers to put one on for any reason), I was concerned I'd feel unwelcome or be treated with hostility because of the possibility that attendees who masked would kick up a fuss in-person about those who didn't, official government advice be damned. These concerns popped up following a discussion someone brought up in a Facebook group I'm in about the consensus on masking for the event. To be clear, I'm not an anti-masker and I, at a minimum, affirm that each and every individual has their own personal boundaries when it comes to their approach on tackling the current pandemic situation. Since a certain point of the pandemic, I personally only mask in places and situations where they're enforced (e.g. public transport, health care settings), and have my face uncovered everywhere else. Has anyone else here had similar feelings not too long ago? Concerns aside, I enjoyed my weekend and it felt great to have in-person conventions again after half a year of nothing",

Just looking at the situation over there, it's making me fear the same could happen at my university. My university has been very restrictive throughout 2020-2021, but seems to have changed stance coming into this semester accepting Covid is something we have to learn to coexist with. I think the reason Cornell discovered such an outbreak is because of their surveillance testing. We don't have surveillance testing here, and one could say that's bad, but I think this helped us avert something similar this semester. My university is huge, so if we had similar testing as Cornell, I'm afraid we'd have detected a similar outbreak and gone remote. I looked through the Cornell subreddit, and it just seems like they're in shambles right now. I honestly feel bad for Cornell students right now after having yet another semester upended by Covid, and who knows about Spring 2022. Even worse, I now have an ominous feeling that the shitshow at Cornell will soon come to my university and we'd see the same thing happen. Is this a preview of what's to come at my university? Is this a preview of the damage Omicron can do? I saw that the Cornell president sent out an email saying why even if a variant is more mild, if it's more transmissible the impact will be more serious, using this to defend the university's decision to close down. Their libraries are closed, dining halls are closed, and exams are moved online. It's the exact kind of nightmarish scenario that I wish would never happen at my university this year. Please don't let my university be next...",

Im just worried that because they have to get fairly close to my face to apply my makeup and that somehow the virus will still be able to infect me. So basically, how safe am I here?",

        "Reddit Post": "Im a Canadian HCW. Our government is losing their minds over this omicron variant. We have like 90% of Canadians vaccinated, but the 10% that are not are ruining things for everyone. Our hospital capacity was terrible before covid, and now it feels like its just always on the brink of being overwhelmed. You would think that in the past 2 years, our government would focus on increasing our hospital capacity and retaining HCWs.. but they havent. At all. So now with any sort of threat of a new wave, we have to lockdown and implement a bunch of restrictions. They are making an announcement tomorrow regarding increasing travel restrictions. This is causing me to spiral for two reasons. 1) I have really bad seasonal depression. I prioritize winter vacations every year and the thought of being stuck in Canada for another winter is unbearable. Because Im an essential worker, if they reinforce a quarantine, that takes away my ability to go on vacation. Meanwhile, I think HCWs and other essential workers need a vacation the most. Not to discredit people who WFH, because I know it can be super draining, but at least you can travel whenever because the quarantine doesnt effect your job. 2) My partner is American. Rumour has it that they are going to ban any non-citizens from entering the country. My partner can WFH so we have relied on his flexibility to be able to see each other. I just cant be separated from him indefinitely again. We were separated for 6+ months last year with no end in sight. Ive never been more depressed. I dont even know what I want out of this post but I just had to type it out because I feel like screaming. If this is how life is going to be every winter, I dont think I want to live it anymore.",

The whole house was sick. I live with my husband, boyfriend, and kid. I was out of town on working so on 12/3 my mom checked in on the kiddo since she is also a nurse. Didn't wear a mask around her. I'm a travel nurse so when my set days off were nearly over I was sick so I got a test so I could go back to work and rapid tested positive 12/6. Mom tested rapid negative 12/7. Friend T who hung out with us literally every day until 11/29 tested negative PCR 12/9. Boyfriend got quite a bit worse over the week so on 12/13 we sent him to a doctor to get covid meds and he tested PCR covid negative. Husband got tested today since his work wanted him to wait and is awaiting PCR results that we won't have for 3+ days. I just found out that my roommate's son in the city I work in is covid home test positive as of today symptoms since Friday. Yesterday was my last day of quarantine so I'm supposed to drive up there Thursday to go to work Friday. We share a bathroom. So what's the issue? I'm terrified that my positive rapid was a false positive, but I don't want to waste nearly $1000 next week renting an Airbnb if I was positive and can't get infected again since I literally had it less than a week ago. So options. 1. Screw it just get an Airbnb. 2. Screw it just stay there. 3. Get a home test. If I'm positive stay if I'm negative get an Airbnb. What would you do or is there something I'm missing???",

I never leave my house (turn down going to bars, restaurants, etc.; have seen the negative effects of it on my social life - constant fomo or not even getting invited anywhere), but always see others with no concern frolicking/traveling. it takes a huge damper on my mental health bc I am trying my best to be cautious and only leaving my house when necessary yet...

But, what if next year is still the same as this year? Yes, the pandemic will end, of course it will, but I'm not so sure it' end the pandemic next year. I was expecting this pandemic to end this year until the Delta Variant came in and I was very disappointed and starting to like 2021 than I hate 2020.

Honestly, I have been very lucky during the pandemic, havent caught COVID, school loans being on pause has allowed my family to save up enough to just pay them off, and I start a new job next week. But just the depressing, bleak outlook still gets to me. Also, even if my family is free of COVID, no one can escape the toll its had on the economy and the fear of whats to come for the economy. Also, though we havent had COVID, we have had just about everything else in my household. Since June 1st, weve experienced hand foot and mouth disease, upper respiratory infections, RSV (almost put my infant in the ER), whatever caused everyone but me to puke their guts out in the middle of the night but wake up fine the next day (happened at 3 different times between my wife and kids), and whatever unidentified shit I caught in late November that gave me a sore throat with the worst pain Ive ever experienced outside of broke bones. I still have a lingering sore throat that wont go the fuck away. Ive lost my taste and smell for the third time in as many months, despite still not getting COVID. Right now, my fear isnt COVID itself, but its effect on the economy and mental health. Im on a long waitlist to see a therapist because despite having a good life. Also, mental health facilities having a waitlist doesnt seem like a good sign. Anyway, anyone that feels hopeless, here is an article that shows we are not alone. It was strangely comforting to me .

Hes been very paranoid about catching covid that he barely leaves his house. My mom is fully vaccinated and my dad is also an anti-vaxer so he is not vaccinated. My parents want me to come regardless of if I quarantine or not, but they asked if I could quarantine for the sake of my brother so we could all be together. I love my family and I wouldnt want to jeopardize their health, but I dont think its fair that I need to quarantine a whole week. Ive done my part by getting the vaccine. I take precautions when I go out like wearing a mask, etc and its not like Im going to crowded areas. Ill also get tested before I go home. I have some last minute shopping to do and if decide to go, then Im selfish for not wanting to quarantine and I dont care if I get my family sick according to my brother. How would you all handle this? Would you quarantine for the sake of your family or do you think its unfair?",

They stayed for 2 days at my sisters house while we did some Christmas shopping this weekend. Sister and her husband are fully vaccinated also. Sister calls Sunday evening to tell me that her husband can't smell or taste. I immediately go get the kids and bring them home. They get tested. She's negative he's positive like we assumed. Monday night the 2 older kids start coughing with no fever. Tuesday they feel like crap so I go get some rapid tests from Walmart. Sure enough they're positive. The 5 year old is completely fine. No symptoms and negative test. As with me and my wife. Right now the 10 year old is getting hit the hardest with fever. We've been rotating Tylenol and motrin every 3 to 4 hours per her pediatrician and she's still coughing quite a bit and saying her belly is hurting some. Same with the 12 year old but her fever is only a low grade one. They're really good kids and decided it would be best if they quarantined to their room and wore a mask when they had to come out so they don't get their little sister sick. I've struggled this entire pandemic to keep their lives as normal as possible while still trying to keep them safe and I'm feeling like a massive failure right now. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that they're going to be fine. Like I know that they will it's just hard to keep my mind from racing. I'm also worried that the little one is going to get it or their mom and me even though we're fully vaccinated. Just wanting some similar stories with good outcomes maybe? And the time line to expect with this fever? I'm not sure why the fever is scaring me so bad that they have. Idk. I'm a \"man\" so it's hard to talk to any of my friends about it and it's easier to get on here and vent to strangers. Sorry for the long post.",

I really had to go to the bathroom and rushed off, in the process completely forgetting to put on my mask between going to the table to the restroom. There were two other people in there (masked), and I was completely maskless. I feel like such an idiot putting myself at risk like that. I'm convinced I'm going to contract the Omicron variant from my stupid mistake, and it just doesn't feel like it was worth it. I'm going to do a rapid test tomorrow or the following day, but I can't shake this upset. Running to the washroom while drinking in a bar has never felt so fraught before. Should I be deeply worried about what happened? Am I overreacting? And will going out ever feel normal again?",

        "Reddit Post": "Throughout the past couple months, I keep trying to have hope that things will get better, but it feels like there's always something that comes along and pulls the rug from underneath. Like I was freaking out over omicron, but then saw it was mild then felt better. But now people say omicron is still dangerous even if it is mild. Also read one source saying the <ORG> vaccine is effective against omicron while another said it's useless, which scares me since I have both <ORG> vaccines and am due for a booster next month. It doesn't help that I work at a movie theater and we have tons of sold out shows for Spiderman. I seriously feel that I should quit having hope because it seems like there's always something that's going to take us back to square one and that I'm not allowed to feel any kind of relief or happiness since so many people are suffering from losing loved ones and dealing with long covid. I had covid back in spring and I was lucky that it was mild, I know many others are not so lucky. It especially sucks since I've been having good things happening to me for the first time in years, like changing my career path by going back to school and enjoying it. But I feel like I'm selfish for being happy when we're still in a deadly pandemic. I'm also afraid I might have to cancel my plans to go to a convention in May I've missed out on the last two years if things continue to spiral downwards. tl;dr I just feel so tired of trying to have hope that the pandemic is starting to improve, or feeling guilty about finding some sort of joy in my life after years of depression when many others don't have that.",

Though I didnt hesitate to get the vaccine, you could say I was technically vaccine-hesitant in my mind because I was already making that call based on that information and thinking about it. Now, it seems like Omicron is less deadly. And meanwhile, the thing that complicates things for me on a personal level is that my tinnitus feels like it has gotten worse. Not correlated due to the vaccine, but somehow on its own weeks after I took the vaccine. I legit dont think the vaccine is the reason for it, but Im in a position where this thing is pretty loud, and inducing an immune response could backfire and make it unbearable. Im legitimately fearful of that at this point. Just how certain is it that the booster wont make me feel more sick as the second shot, to the point of affecting tinnitus? Right now what Im thinking is that I wait 1 or 2 more weeks, since Im off of work and school for the break, and I can observe if a regular sleep pattern and lack of stress will make me habituate again. If that happens, I wont hesitate to take it bu Christmas. Thats the plan right now at least.",

I thought that the restrictions announced yesterday (50% capacity limit with 1000+ people in a venue) wouldn't dent my plans to meetup with family and friends over the holidays, but after hearing the news of more \"circuit-breaker\" measures being considered it just made me think that this is pretty much what we'll have to do in the foreseeable winters, even if we have all the protection in the world from vaccines. Nothing I've done has mattered, I feel like by the time we're truly beyond this, my youth (the years I should have spent meeting people and maybe finding love) will be done and dusted. Sure, I'll get my vaccine and boosters and whatnot, but the powers that be will continue to find ways to ruin everything for me, just as they're doing right now, including forcing online university, online work, and just making my efforts to improve my life utterly in vain. Remember when we thought that the worst of this pandemic would be over in September 2021? I thought so too, but I guess we were wrong.",

        "Reddit Post": "So the past few months I've been doing well and avoided Reddit and other Covid news, and my mental health improved during that time, but since news broke about Omicron, my Reddit/doomscrolling obsession came back full force. I feel like my mental health is going down the drain, but I just couldn't stop sometimes. The reason I couldn't stop sometimes is because I have this irrational fear that if I stopped, I'd just be putting my head in the sand and falling into a delusional slumber, and I won't be \"awake\" to the threat on the horizon. The past few days have been rough. There's been so many times I was reading a news article or a Reddit thread and felt tears welling up in my eyes, but could not stop as my irrational mind feared I'd then fall into a delusional slumber. I am literally destroying my mental health for the sake of staying \"awake\". I need to stop. But I'm starting to notice that whenever I'm browsing Reddit, the most reassuring things I see are updates from well-established Twitter experts that do a good job of describing the situation in a balanced manner (e.g. <PERSON> with the vaccination updates and Chise with the Omicron updates). Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health. So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from? Ones that are balanced in their presentation of the facts - not doom and gloom, but not blindly optimistic either. I'll just go to them for my daily Covid updates from now on, and this way I'll stay \"awake\" without all the needless anxiety.",

Its usually not an issue because our friends and family are all vaccinated and we havent been exposed. But Im having trouble deciding what to do after a recent exposure. I was vaccinated in April and havent gotten my booster yet (Im supposed to get it next Tuesday). I dont have symptoms. Heres the events: On Monday my aunt had a party and I attended. On Tuesday I went to work on my scheduled in-person day. On Wednesday my aunt tested positive for COVID and I was informed that afternoon. I informed my workplace and anybody Id been in contact with about the exposure. On Thursday (today) work sent me to get a rapid test and PCR test done. Rapid test was negative, results from the PCR are supposed to come back Saturday. I updated work et al. Our weekend plans were to see friends Friday through Saturday (sleepover, annual Christmas white elephant party) and to see family on Sunday (their first time seeing our new house and local famous Christmas lights). Weve told the friend hosts and the family that planned to visit that I was exposed and rapid tested negative. The friends said whatever youre comfortable with, the family with young kids is staying home, and the family without kids is going to decide based on PCR. Im mostly worried about spreading it by having gotten tested too early and getting a false negative rapid test. The CDC says get tested 5-7 days after exposure, but the doctor said I was ok to be tested when I did, and dont have to test again unless I develop symptoms. Im thinking that instead of spending the night at our friends, we only go for the party Saturday, stay masked the whole time, and keep an eye out for the PCR results that should come that day. We are going to let our family know about the PCR results and leave the Sunday plans up to their decision. What do you think?",

I immediately began isolating away from my wife and dogs to attempt to prevent the spread. My wife felt completely fine until Thursday, and has now been confirmed positive as well (almost 5 days after my result). This had led to a few questions, and Im curious to learn best practices around isolation here. 1. Given we live together, should I be isolating for the full duration of my wifes 10 days as well, which would effectively be 15 days for me? 2. Is it safe to run errands fully masked after my 10 day isolation is over even though she is still isolating? 3. Is it safe for our dogs to be near us, or do we need to find alternative care for them temporarily? The staggered nature of our symptoms/test results is whats causing the uncertainty around what best practices should be here and we want to make sure were being safe. Any guidance/resources would be helpful! Thanks",

I developed a phobia of face masks after getting sexually assaulted and that happened only a few months before the lockdowns started so it wasn't a long time before I had to deal with them. Masks freak me out because every time I see someone/a group of people/everyone wearing it, I just get reminded of that day, that moment, that guy who assaulted me, over and over again and I have to relive it no matter how much I try not to think about it. I have learned to tolerate my phobia, understand the importance of face masks during this time and not blame people for wearing them at all but I just end up getting more and more frustrated at how long this pandemic has gone on.

Then on Sunday he got a notification that there was an outbreak at his work so he took a rapid test and it was positive. He immediately isolated himself in a different house so we havent seen him since Sunday. Its now Thursday and its been 4 days since our last exposure, 6 days since our first exposure, and we are fine. I am fine. Even if I werent fine, I am thrice vaccinated and my children have both doses of <ORG>. So why is my anxiety through the roof? I realize that its now beyond my control, but Im still freaking out. Yeah, I am overweight and a former party girl but I dont know of any other conditions that would cause me to become super sick. My children are all very healthy.

Personal risk assessment request here: My parents and brother were going to take a direct flight from Pittsburgh to Austin next week to visit me and my husband for the holidays. Theyve all been boosted with moderna since October. They all have comorbidities (overweight, parents with controlled hypertension, brother has asthma). Im getting my booster this Saturday. I was exposed to Covid by my husband during the delta surge. He had a breakthrough case then. Me and hubs were vaccinated. We feel hes safe for another month before he needs a booster. Regardless, it looks everyone and their grandmas is getting Covid tonight in NYC/DC.. so were just kind of dumbfounded. I have a generalized anxiety disorder so Im pretty sure the worst (and slightly probable) outcome is that my family comes down with some sickness before they fly out. We were planning on just cooking at home and not really seeing any other groups. I plan on staying away from stores and the gym, just go into the office wear everybody is masked and vaccinated at least twice. This honestly all feels so goddamn insane to me this is the SECOND holiday season where Covid is in the background lurking as a threat like why? What the fuck was this all for? Can all just get this fucking virus and go home? Ugh.",

My dad keeps talking about how things will only get worse. Omicron is way more deadly and contagious than Delta and how if we dont isolate ourselves were gonna die. My family is fully vaccinated and my parents have also gotten a booster and I had Covid a month ago. I cant keep living like this. Ive been in isolation since I was 19. Im now 21 and Im so lonely and miserable and I have nothing to look forward to. I keep myself busy with art and I collect and read comic books but I still feel so empty and trapped. I sometimes wish Covid was deadlier so we can all die now and get it over with. I think being in isolation has given me CPTSD and I have very bad mood swings. I also have panic attacks every time my dad talks about how things will only get worse or that I have to learn to live like this. I cant see a therapist because my dad says mental health is the biggest lie doctors have ever told us and that I should ignore my feelings like people used to do in the old days. I just cant take this anymore. Ive posted here before many times and every times I do everyone tells me to move out which is not an option because I dont have money and I cant get money cuz Im not allowed to have a job because for Covid",

They knew winter means more infection, which makes it different to Delta peaking in warmer months. They knew and chose to do nothing, till last minute we get a huge rush of restrictions do now everything except shops, bars/restaurants (but only serving alcohol till 10pm wow!!!) and essential services can be open. This is \"untill we can control the infection and know enough about omicron\", so basically indefinite. The government excuses today at the press meeting included \"well it wasn't so bad wjth Delta so we didn't expect this with Omicron!!!\" (Omicron is in mid winter) And \"upping intensive capacity is accepting that more people will die\" (ok but what for example about the many covid patients who aren't in intensive care but still need to be isolated from non-positve patients?). I am so angry and it is hard to cope with, how can I not believe this will continue every winter for years when this is how it is being handled? Sure omicron itself couldn't specifically be predicted, but they knew new variants would come, and they knew winter numbers would rise, and they did nothing till it got to almost lockdown level of bad. If this was th last winter we'd spend like this I would handle it much better, as most of my fear is coming from this being a yearly thing indefinitely, but it feels more and more like it will keep happening. The government refusing to support the healthcare enough till it gets to this state, vaccines are not enough on their own. This feels hopeless.",

Everyone reassured us our high vaccination rate would help, but just as I expected, our high population density seems to be kicking our ass just like it did in April 2020. We may have a high vaccination rate working in our favor, but we also have a high population density working against our favor.

My dad is the only person I know who is not vaccinated, but not just that- he refuses to get covid tested as well. I haven't spent longer than one day at home since August, before I started grad school, because of this issue. He's been sick this past week, but I don't know with what. He's never officially had covid before, neither have I or my mom. He actually lied and said he got tested when he really didn't. He claims covid testing \"puts something in your body.\" He even refuses at-home testing. I have tried literally everything to convince him to get vaccinated and tested. Literally every argument I could think of. I simply have no more patience at this point to continue arguing with him. And even though he hasn't gotten sick throughout this whole pandemic, with how transmissible the new variant is, it seems to be pretty inevitable. He works retail, and to add to it all, he's also anti-mask. I didn't go home for Thanksgiving for this reason, and of course my parents were both pissed. Now that Christmas is coming, they're even more angry as you can imagine. Realistically I know I wouldn't be severely ill if I got covid (vaccinated, 21 and healthy) but I'm absolutely terrified of getting a mild case and having it develop into long-haul covid. That's my biggest fear. I'm not sure what to do here. I spent Thanksgiving with a few vaccinated friends, but everyone's with their families for Christmas, and I don't want to be alone. Another option is for my mom to come over to my apartment, without my dad, but at the same time I feel guilty for leaving him alone on Christmas. Am I exaggerating with this? I don't want to spend Christmas alone but at the same time I really don't want to potentially have long-haul symptoms for months or even years because of this decision.",

Chise (the moderna scientist on twitter) is maintaining that the omicron variant is not that bad for those who are not immune-naive (meaning they got infected or they've been fully vaccinated and boosted) and even showing that the omicron variant in particular replicates more in the throat than in the lungs, which is a very good sign that covid pneumonia might not be that common with Omicron. However all the media seems to be talking about today is how this new variant is the worst thing to ever happen and that we have no protection because vaccinated people are testing positive (despite many I've heard of having very mild to no symptoms) and how we need to shut down everything again. I ended up getting banned from the main coronavirus sub because I didn't agree with the doom and gloom narrative that's being pushed by the news today and I'm honestly really upset and angry about it. All the data coming out of South Africa is pointing twoards Omicron not being a major problem for people who are not immune naive but I'm constantly being gaslit by everybody....",

But I took a chance and went to see a band months ago in a small venue once I'd been fully vaccinated. Literally counted less than 60 people in a hall that normally houses 600-700. Double masked, sanitized, the whole bit. Then this week... I researched this place, same size as the other venue. Concert wasn't sold out, looked like plenty of room, good ventilation and the band insisted on masks. The venue ignored the mask rule. Absolutely packed the place. The second band (which was horrible btw) kept encouraging crowd surfing and moshing and it went nuts. But by this time...I've invested 5 hours into this. I think it will be over in a few songs and I don't know that any of these people even want to be around for the actual headliner. But it went on and on. And then the headliner comes on. They are clearly annoyed with the venue but they too encourage \"the energy\" (paraphrasing) and do nothing to stop this. It is stifling, even when I move back from it all. So I'm freaking out at this point (right now) thinking I wasted all that effort all that time quarantining and I could end up sick over this stupid decision and one truly sh!##y band. I did just lose my best friend earlier this year to Covid. I should have known better. Logically, I'm boosted. I was double masked. I sanitized everything I touched. The odds of anything bad happening are statistically so radically small, but my brain won't hear it, so I've been having trouble sleeping...",

That suggests to me that in principle, coronavirus is can sometimes spread that way, even if the original COVID-19 coronavirus did not. So, when the virus mutates, is it reasonable to suppose that it might have found ways to transmit through fomites or food?

I feel like if the full lockdown in the UK happens again, it's pretty much a guaranteed sign that this is how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives: 8 months of freedom, 4 months of lockdowns every year. If the coming January-February is gonna be the same as the previous one even with the vaccines and new treatments, what's the guarantee that January 2023, 2024 or 2030 won't be the same? If we have a mutation that can avoid immunity from vaccines that initially had 95% effectiveness, what can be the rational reason to believe that we won't have a mutation that can completely avoid the first, second or third booster? People are saying that this pandemic will certainly end and covid will just become like cold/flu, but I feel like this virus has completely binned every normal epidemiological rule we knew. Most of those \"other\" pandemics we talk about were usually over or coming to a close by the two-year mark, and even if they weren't they at least weren't getting worse by that point due to increased immunity. Those other viruses weren't approaching the R rate similar to that of measles. What's the rational justification for the belief that this won't just continue indefinitely? I feel like at this point it'd just be easier for me to give up and finally accept that this is how life's gonna be. I know I will certainly never be fully happy with this, but maybe next generations will manage to mentally adapt to it, just like humans adapted to everything else. Can someone give me any rational assurance that it is still possible to ever come back to normal?",

I am triple vaxxed and am still being very careful. I know my risk tolerance is much lower than most, as I've had a stroke, kidney failure, and have an autoimmune condition. My fiance and I are supposed to visit his triple vaxxed family for the holidays and spend time indoors with his unvaccinated extended family. We are then planning on spending the days afterward with my family, including my sister and her fiance who will first fly to a big family reunion and then fly to see us. A lot of these people either work very public jobs (i.e. supermarket) or do many activities that are beyond my risk level (i.e. daily unmasked gym workouts). I love Christmas and being with family so much, but I'm so scared and just want to stay at home curled up and have a safe, cozy Christmas with my puppy. I just want to cry because I feel trapped and like I have to attend these events or else I'll upset everyone, and that everyone will think I'm overreacting. Thank you so much for your attention and I wish you and your loved ones a healthy, happy holiday!",

We were super close before the pandemic, we used to hang out every weekend, she helped me realize I was transgender. And then when the pandemic happened it tore my old friend group apart. They are only 2 that I can somewhat regularly see now. And with one of them we've frequently gotten into disagreements over what is safe post vaccine. And now we can't see each other very often because a) she's really busy with other things now, and b) she thinks my decision to go to concerts and Florida last month was really stupid. So far I've tried going to meetup groups, online dating, and even zoom groups. And so far I haven't found anyone that I really feel like I connect super well with and I can do things like travel with. I did find some people for edc Orlando that I connected with super well, but they all live very far away from me. Overall I feel like if I died that people wouldn't really miss me given that I can't find new friends that I can connect with super well post vaccine. And omicron is gonna make it way harder to connect with people and go to social gatherings. Ive also tried finding mental health support groups in person and I've had 0 luck because there's none in my area. They are some in Florida, but Florida is very far away from me. I'm only going to be able to afford to go once next year. I'm also concerned that my area could have more lockdowns eventually, omicron is hitting even well vaccinated areas like NYC pretty hard",

My girlfriend couldnt even see me for the entire year. My mother would go to her job and the store come home and I would stay home and do online classes. Of course this messed with my mental health but I was used to it. I dont have a job due to him, I cant go back to normal classes bc of him. My mother and him would get into shouting matches every week bc he would force her to wash her hands after touching her face or when she bringing in stuff and the item would accidentally touch her clothes. In April of this year and I finally was able to go out bc I got vaccinated everything felt like it was going back to normal of course since omicron and delta is around he is going back to being controlling ways. I cant even go in my backyard without a mask. I have to lie to him just to go wherever I want to. He doesnt even want me to go to her house and were all vaccinated. He yelled at me just because I went in the backyard with my slippers and walked back in with it on. I bought clothes from someone off of an app and he tells me how Im putting the family at risk for doing that. He tells me how I must want to kill myself with the virus because I shouldnt order clothes from anyone even thought the clothes is new and I wash it after buying it. Its getting to the point where Im starting to dislike him. This isnt the same man who raised me. Im 23 Im not 16 or 15 Im a grown ass man and he still wants me to act like the child I was.

(Frequent fainting at work made me increasingly unreliable) The only problem is that Im working at a Gamestop in the middle of the second worst county in the country in terms of new Covid cases. Im double vaxxed and got my booster last week, but Im not a healthy woman. (76lbs underweight and anemic) When I get sick, I get *siiiick*. I was also recently taken off my parents health insurance, so if I get a particularly bad case of Rona, Ill just have to die because Ill never be able to afford hospitalization. Luckily, Gamestop has taken *some* precautions. My store has a Masks STRONGLY recommended sign on the door, but only the employees actually wear masks. Theres also a hand sanitizer dispenser by the door. Theres no bag in it, so its useless, but the thought is there. Im a few days into this job, and Ive probably been within three feet of three-hundred people without masks on. Maskless kids are common, coughing without covering their mouths then touching the displays. I have to take used games and consoles from strangers who might have kept them in a house with five sick individuals for all I know. Its terrifying. I cant NOT work. I have $34.01 in my bank account, and I still havent gotten Christmas gifts for my family (which they are VERY vocal about expecting, but thats a vent post for another subreddit). I know I have to work, but its getting really, really hard to convince myself to show up and actually *risk my life* for $9/hr. Im scheduled for forty more hours this week, which Im thankful for because hooray money, but horrified at the potential consequences. I just want someone to tell me my fears are valid and that Im not a weenie for being worried about my situation. My situation being risking what is *probably* my certain death in pursuit of earning less than nine dollars an hour. Every second Im there Im teetering on the edge of a panic attack. Its awful and I just want to quit, but I cant and I feel trapped.",

My father and I are both fully vaccinated but the rest of our family is not. I am wondering what to do if my father or I gets COVID while we are out of state. I would ideally like to drive back home (a 5 hour trip) in the event either of us get sick but am not sure if it would be better/safer to instead bring my father for treatment immediately (while out of state) instead of driving five hours back home to bring him to his own local hospital. I know it is imperative to receive immediate treatment when a person is high risk so am concerned about making the long trip home. If I get COVID and my father does not, my sibling doesn't have enough space to self isolate so I could not stay at the house and would have to drive home. The problem is with this scenario is that my father would need to come with me (I am his caretaker) but I would be worried sick that he would get COVID from me on the long five hour drive back home. I also wouldn't be able to leave my father at my siblings house with six unvaccinated family members while I self-isolate due to his being high risk. I have discussed the dangers and have pleaded with my father not to go, but we haven't been to my siblings since COVID started and he hasn't seen his grandchildren and yearns to spend time with them over the holiday, so is determined to go despite the risks. I am worried sick about this and would appreciate any advice or guidance others may have regarding this terrible predicament.",

Last year, nothing was on the up, everything was negative, over 4k deaths per day, everything shut down, outdoor mask mandates everywhere, barely any people vaccinated, and so on. Now, this winter is better because we do not have most of last years craziness. Omicron is shit but remember, the vaccines still work well against it, and more people are getting vaccinated daily. By February or March, the situation will hopefully get better, and we will see the same discussions that we had last Feb/March/April/May. It will get better very soon, I can guarantee that. For those who are asking, at one point, governments will notice that restrictions and mask mandates are counterproductive for the vaccination effort, and that in future pandemics, governments will find a lot of anti-vaxxers who have rejected the vaccine because of the restrictions that the government is levying on the vaccinated, so to avoid this scenario, governments will lift these restrictions sooner than later.",

She told me that I could bring it in another day and get it filled out because my dose information would be in their system. Perfect, so I get the shot and go home. Three days later I come back to a CVS, and I'm asking a (different) pharmacist to fill out my card with the information in the system. He tells me there is no documentation of my second dose at all. He tells me to check with the state department and I do: they tell me the same thing. So apparently there is no information about my second vaccine dose, which has been pretty troubling considering you need the vaccine card to get into a lot of places now. In fact, this caused an extended crisis with my university where I was nearly removed from courses until I explained my situation to quite a few different people in higher positions. Obviously I'm tired of this whole thing. I was wondering if it would be a bad idea for me to just go on ahead and get two full rounds of the <ORG> vaccine (in other words, just restart my vaccination process altogether). I know folks overseas who first got the Sinopharm vaccine before it was approved by the FDA, and had to get <ORG> when travelling to the States. Could this kind of thing have any health implications? Can you recommend it (or discourage it) to the best of your knowledge? I'm just kinda tired of being in this limbo status.",

I have two doses of the <ORG> vaccine, but have been six months out from the last date (my second dose was completed on Memorial Day). I went to schedule a booster today, and nowhere within range has a booster dose that I need, which is exhausting. I dont have major holiday plans, but Im nervous to go into the grocery store because theres a good chance Im probably going to run into omicron one way or the other. I am obese, which puts me at high risk for COVID, but I am fairly young (24). I stay masked wherever I go, but Im still experiencing pretty extreme anxiety and feeling like my vaccine is useless against this new variant. I plan on getting boosted, but currently do not have the opportunity. Should I isolate from people until I get boosted?",

While she's home now, she's still suffering, and she has remarked that the idea that Omicron is \"milder\" may anecdotally not always be universally accurate. She does have some pre-existing conditions but before this was not someone I would consider incapable of living her life or who was obviously disabled in any way. I am starting to rethink my own holiday plans in light of this development, and I'm beginning to become worried about whether my university will be back in person next semester (part of me is hoping we're not, but then that means it'll be because things are worse). What I sincerely want for everyone reading is to have a safe, happy, careful holiday season that results in no illness, no undue stress, and no surprise visits to the ER. I want us to all live through this scary time and know that in the new year there will be additional treatment options and things that may further mitigate this, but right now it is indeed rocky and shaky.

        "Reddit Post": "I had my first jab back in July. Got the <PERSON> one dose which absolutely destroyed me for 2 and a half days. High fever, shivers, aches, nausea, etc. not fun. Long story short, I had my <ORG> booster last Thursday and I was prepared for a very rough time from the moment I exited the vaccine center. 12 hours went by, then 24 then 48. No side effects other than a really sore arm that felt like a bad bruise which is already gone. No fever, no headaches, no muscle pain nothing to indicate that my immune system is actually registering the mRNA booster and doing anything. Now I know symptoms aren't always indicative of immune function but I can't help feeling like I'm not really protected? I don't have evidence of this but strangely enough I would've felt so much better if it had hit me really hard like my initial vaccine dose. Do you think I'm still getting the full benefits of the booster even with no signs of any immune response?",

Now I used to love going to those back before Covid, some of my best memories are going to a midnight openings!! Anywho, as Omicron is making its rounds I was a little uneasy about going. My family and I are all vaccinated (Some boosted, as myself I have to wait for my 6 months since I got my 2nd shot in September) and I was told I shouldn't worry, that it's all in my head. To which I was like \"no mask, people unmasking to eat (I'm still 100% on masks got my good old KN95 real ones, as my family does wear them unless the town mandates it), with a sold out show. Because that's safe\". Get told I'm wasting my life by not doing anything, blah blah blah I'm sure a lot of you have heard this same song and dance. What I hate is, I'm a natural introvert. I like my peace, quiet and solitude and always have. But the constant fight back and me wanting to feel safe puts a strain on me that no one understands. I had Covid in March, and my Mother had it in May and was in the hospital. She is fine, but still like, it puts a mental strain on ya a bit. Also she wasn't going. Still, I just feel that my family needs to think a little bit before doing gatherings. Hell, I suggested to see it on a Monday afternoon after work. Honestly, the best time can enjoy the movie. Oh no, gotta see it during the hype crowd cheering which I get. Anywho, I feel better I made this post. Thanks for listening.",

My dad isn't doing great, and we finally convinced him to get to the hospital yesterday after his pulseox read 88. They found at the hospital he has pneumonia, and let him go the same day as his pulseox jumped back up to 94. He's had constant fevers, coughing fits super bad, can't sleep, won't eat, and the only thing they gave him was an inhaler. He has numerous health issues as he's a smoker, drinker, and has bad kidnies, and I'm honestly scared covid is gonna do him in. All the ICUs in my area are overflowing so they couldn't get him transferred, so now he's just at home wasting away.. it's just breaking me up inside because I know covid is probably going to take hold of him. I don't know how I'm going to be able to handle that which is a very likely event..",

The <ORG> ceo recently said that we might need a 4th shot \"sooner than expected\" which worries me. I was hoping that it would only be yearly but clearly that's not the case because the virus mutates way too fast for the vaccines to stop transmission. And then also on a abc news interview fauci said masks on airplanes will never go away which is really scary to me. Because if what he's saying is correct it means mask mandates will never truly go away which will ruin my life forever. Masks make communication so much harder, people misgender me and I don't like how I look with a mask. When I was in Orlando last month it felt so liberating to not have to wear a mask and be fully glammed up with makeup. [url]",

Because of a family problem, I had to go back to my home (not EU) country last summer, but had only gotten my first (<ORG>) jab. I then got my second jab (again <ORG>) in my home country. When I got back to the EU, however, I found out that getting my second jab would *not* entitle me to get my EU corona certificate, which would mean quarantine and/or testing before/after travel to any other EU country. My home country refused to allow my proof of vaccination in my home country as legit; very frustrating. Because I need to travel for work, I just opted for the path of least resistance - because I officially hadn't gotten my second jab in my residence (EU) country, I just had a third jab there (this time, <ORG>). The timing was approximately: 1st jab, late June (EU/<ORG>); 2nd jab, early July (non-EU/<ORG>); third jab, early September (EU/<ORG>). I'm in a queue now for my booster shot, but I may have to travel back to my home country because of yet another family problem - and with Omicron, and three long flights, I'm worried. So I'm wondering - did my third jab, back in September, afford me any additional protection? Or was it just overkill - of, if it had given me any additional protection, perhaps it's all worn off by now? Thanks for any solid input.",

Does anyone suggest maybe 4 or 5 weeks instead of 3 or something like that or have any more knowledge on this aspect?

He has been an essential worker throughout this whole pandemic as he works for hospitals, government buildings, schools, nursing homes, you name it and he's been in it. He probably goes to 5 to 10 places a day depending. We have managed to dodge COVID this entire time. He always wears a mask and he is vaccinated (2x <ORG> with last dose being in May) but hadn't gotten boosted yet. :/ Today he got a call to go to our local jail, only to have the guy who let him in tell him he picked a bad day to come (the jail called in for support though...) because they had 40 POSITIVE CASES. My husband called his boss who told him to suck it up and if he was wearing a mask he'd be fine. My husband never came close to any of the inmates as he was in a back room the whole time, wore his KN95 mask, and was there for less than 30 mins but we are both freaking out. Why the fuck did they not tell him before he went in???? And right before Christmas too. Just great. When should he get tested? The options around here are already so limited because of cases blowing up. I'm so upset and scared. I'm immunocompromised but triple vaxxed... still. I hate this, I'm so tired of this all.",

The point of this post is to reassure that even though 2021 in the end was a disappointment, Everyone is getting serious for 2022. Finally I am aware recently on this sub and elsewhere people have been giving up but think about this you made it through 2020, then you made it through all of 2021. That shows how strong you really are. Let's enter the new year together and put an end to this global evil once and for all! Ask questions if you want. I am here for anybody.",

I received a positive COVID test on 12/15 and had a bad case of symptoms. I quarantined in our families basement and was praying that I wouldnt get anyone in my family sick. However, I woke up this morning to my father in the basement with me. He developed a sore throat yesterday and he let me know he just tested positive this morning (12/20). He is 51, fully vaxxed, had a heart attack 10+ years ago in which he had triple bypass and open heart surgery. He is on medication for life including blood thinners and he has sleep apnea I believe. However he has really made a change in his diet and lifestyle since his heart attack. He exercises almost every day and some could call him a health nut now lol. He signed up today to receive antibodies so hopefully in the next day or so he will qualify and can receive it. My father is my best friend and I feel an immense amount of guilt on my shoulders because I probably was the one who got him sick. If anything happens to him I wont be able to live with myself. If anyone could provide me with some reassuring words I would really love that.. My friends have dropped off the face of the earth and havent even checked to see how Im doing so I feel very alone right now. I appreciate any words and hope everyone is staying safe.",

Im 26F, 123 lbs, 5.2, no known health conditions, on birth control, that just got her booster shot. I originally had the moderna shots but then switched to <ORG> for the booster. My first shot of moderna gave me no symptoms. Second shot was intense but I recovered within less then 48 hours with no lingering symptoms. This time around, I have developed some pain near my rib cage which Im assuming is near one of my axiallary lymph nodes. I know this has been a reported but not frequent side effect (maybe 10-11% report this?). Im very concerned that this immune response is damaging long term. Again, this pain wasnt noticeable until over 48 hours from injection and it comes and goes. I got the booster over 2 days ago. As a layperson, I would feel more COMFORTABLE getting vaccines that dont cause such immunogenicity in me. I typically never react to the flu shots, I got my flu shot this past month as well. I am not convinced that everyone needs to continue to take these shots, and everyone that does have more long lasting or severe side effects should avoid these shots. Is there any basis to my fears or are these shots actually safe?",

I had it finally scheduled for November when my husband contracted covid from a co-worker and brought it home. So before i got my second dose, everyone in my home (me, and kids as well) caught covid. We quarantined, ordered food so we didn't have to go out etc. Did everything by the book. We recovered (luckily it was very mild for us) and are back to work and school. Here are my questions. Everyone around is getting booster shots and now even children are getting shots. I've been asking around as to whether we should get boosters or not and i keep getting mixed answers. Some people are telling me since i got covid, it's not necessary for me to get any vaccine for a while, we got the antibodies in us so we're good. Including the kids. Other people are telling me to get the second dose and to vaccinate my kids..I asked our doctor and he is just as mixed as everyone else...He basically said \"its up to you\" Ugh..Could anyone here please tell me what we should be doing and why?

A few days ago, we found out our college age nephew has COVID. He is quarantining in the upstairs of their home. His younger, 10 year old brother is not vaccinated. On top of that, my wife's older brother has cancer and is receiving all sorts of immunotherapy to keep the brain, bone and liver cancer at bay. We were supposed to be visiting with him on this trip too. One of my biggest worries through all of the pandemic was the fear of me infecting someone else. Indefinitely don't want to infect her brother. We found out that our family members at our destination are still eating out in restaurants, (with unvaccinated family members), going to exercise classes, and playing group sports. And when my wife talked to them last night, it sounds like they shamed her for considering not making the trip and coaxing her by saying, \"Are you going to hide in your house forever?\", and \"You know there's just going to be another variant after this one, right? It's not going to end, so start living your life\". Disclaimer: we have been living our lives and getting back some normality (eating in restaurants, going to some group events) but we choose to do things when there are not huge crowds and masked. Now my wife wants to go just to prove them wrong to show them she's not scared. Well, I'll admit, I'm a little frightened. It's not that I think I'm going to die from COVID at this point, but I still do have concerns for spreading the virus AND I generally don't like getting sick, especially if I'm far from home and have to drive 10 hours back home.

Yesterday afternoon and into today I started experiencing mild cold symptoms (tickle in throat, very slight cough and very slight stuffy nose). Naturally, I'm panicking because, while it is cold season, I'm fearing that I have COVID, and the timing could not be worse. Not only am I supposed to see my family during the holiday, I also went to a couple holiday parties over the weekend. &amp;#x200B; I had COVID in January and I am fully vaccinated, but have not yet received my booster. I am 28 years old. I am planning on getting tested today. While worrying that I will miss the opportunity to see my family over Christmas is hard enough, if I test positive I would need to tell everyone I saw at work yesterday and over the weekend that I tested positive, and they would then need to get tested and potentially ruin their holidays. I would feel like such an awful person and that all of my friends and colleagues would see me as the one who ruined their Christmas. I really hope it's just a cold, but last time I thought I had a cold I got tested and wound up with COVID. I know this might sound selfish but I almost considered not getting tested just so I wouldn't know if I had it or not, but I know the moral thing to do is find out. Everyone I was at the parties with is vaccinated so hopefully they are okay if I test positive. &amp;#x200B; Am I doing the right thing? What if I had it a month ago and didn't notice, and I test positive because of the antibody and it's just a cold masquerading as COVID symptoms? How do I deal with the burden of potentially ruining the holidays of all my friends, putting others at risk? This is really weighing me down mentally and I could use support. I'm getting teary-eyed at the thought of spending Christmas alone. It's the one time of year I look forward to the most :(",

As the title states, I would greatly appreciate some insight on how long it took you (or someone you know) who is FULLY VACCINATED (two doses) to test negative after being infected. For example, how many days/weeks/months from the day you found out you had COVID to the day you finally tested negative did it take? I am finally on my last day of isolation, but I still would like to test negative before seeing my family and friends. Isolation has been the worst part of it all for me. Seriously, it is like being in prison. Luckily I'm able to return to work tomorrow, but I am still going to refrain from seeing my friends and family until I test negative.

We think she was exposed last Monday, I stayed over at his house on Wednesday after and saw him but didnt go into the house on Saturday. He doesnt like his roommates too much so he has minimal interactions with them. We are only double vaxxed (have a booster booked for mid January). She is pretty much asymptomatic, but decided to take a test to be safe for Christmas. My bf and I have no symptoms yet and my rapid test came out negative but those are pretty unreliable. He has his PCR booked for the 23rd, I have mine tomorrow. My anxiety is through the roof, I saw 2 of my friends after my bf so I hate that they might be exposed too. Is there any chance we didnt get it? The other roommate btw who probably had a lot more direct interactions with her had a negative rapid test which is kind of promising but Im not getting my hopes up. I have a cottage weekend booked in 2 weeks and thats literally the only thing that kept me going so now thats probably is gone too. And my province is probably going into lockdown soon. I lost all hope. Im so scared to develop symptoms and to have long COVID. I feel like I have symptoms but Im probably just freaking out at this point.",

Whenever I think about this current semester Im like what if that was my last time ever sitting there and I start crying. Im getting March 2020 vibes from omicron and iy sucks. And I hate how people invalidate me by saying well people are dying. Hospitals are being overwhelmed, etc. Im so aware of that. But two things can be true at once: I can acknowledge covid while also being upset about my senior year. I hate how people act as though one is selfish for missing a crucial part of their life that they will never get back. I thought about seeing a therapist so that o can process what Im going through but of course long waitlists. Im honestly spiraling so much and theres so many new cases in the state that Im in. It sucks if just sucks for everyone. I just know my college is going to announce remote",

At first I believed that it was because of the pollution, the aqi levels in my city were up high at 350 and I normally do get a scratchy throat and sinus issues because of it. I'm 19 and fully vaccinated and everyone that I live with (except for my 15 year old sister) is fully vaccinated too. But today, my sore throat has gotten worse (its uncomfortable to gulp) and I'm sneezing a lot, which apparently isn't listed as a covid symptom but I'm getting really paranoid and I think I've caught covid. I've resorted to natural home remedies like honey ginger tea and drinking warm water for some relief but sneezing with a sore throat is the most painful feeling ever. My father (who is taking this very lightly because he thinks he knows everything) says that it's seasonal because I don't have cough or fever but I really don't want to take a chance and infect my sister. Should I get tested right away or wait for sometime? (though my anxiety wants me to go for it right away)",

Tickets are bought, suitcase is (almost) packed. But now I'm freaking out. People in my home country are not very keen on the COVID measures, to say the least. Very few people wear masks, a lot of the population still isn't vaccinated, QR-codes mostly aren't getting checked, so it could be quite dangerous. Especially for me, because if the worst scenario happens and I'll get COVID - I'm fucked royally, since I don't have an insurance of my home country and they won't even let me in the plane. But the alternative doesn't seem much better, because if I won't fly, I'll be all alone during my holidays (I don't have any friends besides her), and I can await a sad, pathetic and lonely NYE. Not to mention that a good chunk of money will be lost (plane tickets are non-refundable sadly) and don't even get me started about how pissed off my friend would be because of the last moment flaking. So, what would be the more reasonable choice? Thank you in advance.",

I saw this article today and cant stop thinking about it. [Rolling Stone article]([url] It says that 50% of COVID patients regardless of vaccine have developed long COVID and contains the quote When you weigh the risks of benefits of your plans, be sure to include potential for life-ruining chronic illness with no cure or end in sight to your list of risks. What am I supposed to do in the face of that information? I have plans tomorrow to fly home and see my family who are vaccinated and boosted and take precautions as well (my brother recently got back from a cruise but tested negative with a rapid test and is waiting on a PCR result before driving to see us, but he may come down even if he tests positive and just wear a mask in the house). I feel like I am in a rabbit hole now of Twitter threads and news articles where people describe how horrible their symptoms are and that avoiding COVID at all costs should be your number one goal in life. to paraphrase one Twitter user. Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this stress? I feel like I should avoid traveling in case my brother has COVID even though that would mean spending Christmas alone.

He thinks the way they call it a vaccine when it \"isn't a vaccine at all, it's a shot\" (????) is suspicious. I told him it's just semantics at this point but he insists that it means something is up I've told him \"look at everyone around us who got vaxxed and boosted, they're fine\", but it feels like there's no getting through to him. I could just take the \"okay well deal with the consequences\" route but that's easier said than done with a family member. If happen to get it, I know I'll be fine, but him? I don't know.

Then March 2020 hit, and I got sent to online learning. Then for the entirety of the 2020-2021 school year I was online. Now, finally I got to go back to in-person in 2021-2022, but with masking and distancing and stuff like that. I know it's not big of a deal, but I wanted to have the entire, normal high school experience. When the vaccines came out I thought things would finally get better, my school was actually talking about holding in-person assemblies/mass gatherings in 2022. Then Omicron came :( If this ends at the end of 2022 then half of my grade 12 will be finished. That means my \"normal\" high school would have only been the first half of grade 9 and the last half of grade 12,.. I know it sounds stupid, but I really wanted to experience high school, ah well, hopefully my university will be normal. :(",

I had a lung collapse, and a lung surgery when I was 17, and dealt with some pain for a few years after, mostly in extreme weather conditions. 5 years later, that hasn't been an issue and I honestly don't feel like I've ever had surgery, but now I have COVID and I don't know what to do. I was exposed on Thursday unknowingly, started showing symptoms on Saturday, that I found out on Monday may have been due to exposure, so I got tested. My symptoms (knock on wood) as of now are mild. They feel like common cold symptoms except for the migraine that persisted from Sunday-Tuesday. I had a cough that has lessened, and I don't have much chest congestion thankfully. Now, I can't tell if I'm scaring myself into thinking I'm short of breath, or ACTUALLY short of breath. I work in an ER so I'm seeing this firsthand. I don't want to go get admitted unless this is a really severe case but I also don't want to minimize it. Has anyone in this group had covid and .. recovered well? I don't want to get too excited that my symptoms are seemingly mild, and suddenly take a turn. I am also vaccinated, just didn't get a booster.",

The two here with us came Sunday, shared a meal with mom Saturday evening and little to no contact after. The other two had little to no contact with mom on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and today. They tested negative this morning. It looks like there's no smart way to let them come anyway but I am trying to see if there's anything we are missing. Everyone in the house has at least 2 doses, the immunocompromised person has 3 doses more than 14 days from becoming immunocompromised. The immunocompromised person could self isolate, keep window open, use a separate fridge and bathroom until they all go back home. BUT it's possible they could give the virus to a 5yo who would then have to stay home from preschool for 10 days, which would be a big burden as the person who would be watching him is the immunocompromised person.",

Were all vaccinated and my parents are planning to get tested in the next couple of days. Based on this info, do you guys think its alright for me to go back?

Since then, shes become pretty sick. I spent quite a bit of time with her on Monday and Tuesday - unmasked. Not only are we co-workers but were also sort of buddies. I immediately tested on Tuesday and came back negative. However, if I was exposed to her on Monday or Tuesday, then it most likely wouldnt show up. I am getting tested again tonight (Thursday). However, I have a flight out tomorrow to visit my parents for the week. My parents are in their early to mid 60s. They are in good health, except my mom isnt vaccinated. I am now faced with this situation where I could potentially test positive here in the next couple of days. I dont want to risk it to my parents but they say they dont care, its worth the risk to them. I told them thats not the point, you may not care but if something happens I will be the one to deal with it. The other thought going through my mind is that I havent seen my mom in forever and I dont want to stay separated from them forever. I would be destroyed if something happened to them and I havent seen them in years. However, I could cause the same thing by traveling. My gut says I shouldnt. Its not worth the risk. But I am also feeling the pressure (particularly from my dad) to come home. I want to so bad and I know statistically speaking nothing drastic is likely to happen but I just want to do the right thing. This on top of the general risk of contracting the virus in the airport. Any advice?",

        "Reddit Post": "From what I've noticed reading a lot of testimonials about fully vaccinated people testing positive for covid in the wake of the Omicron variant, how many of them, despite not being very sick, always say how horrible they feel for getting the virus in the first place and they essentially beat themselves up for getting covid. Despite being vaccinated, people still view getting covid as some kind of moral failing when it really isn't. Covid is a virus that's still circulating worldwide, so testing positive for it isn't something to be totally surprised by. I really dont think there should be a stigma around testing positive for covid in the post-vaccine era. I know that there is always the question of \"what if I get an unvaccinated immunocompromised person sick?\" thats not the same thing as shooting them point blank in the head with a gun, and secondly, theres no reason why immunocompromised people should be walking around completely immune naive against covid, simply being immunocompromised isn't a reason to not get vaccinated, if anything it's a reason **TO** get vaccinated. Anyway, the point of this is to say, just because you test positive for breakthrough covid doesn't mean you're an inherently bad or selfish person. Things happen.",

I mean, remember we thought that this year in 2021, we thought it'll finally be the end of the pandemic since we've got the vaccines. Sadly, the pandemic didn't end this year and I was very disappointed about that. Sure, it's better than last year, but not the greatest recovery we ever had. Of course, we almost end the pandemic last summer until the Delta and Omicron came to stop it. I was hoping that 2022 may be the end of the pandemic and returning to normal, but with the Omicron (even though it's mild) going on, I'm not sure it'll end that quickly. As for the vaccines, I've just found out that our vaccination rate in the U.S. is 61% for fully vaccinated. Which is not bad, but it would've been higher. I've heard that we won't be back to normal until we reach either 80% or 90% vaccination rate, which I'm afraid it's going to be a long time, So I'm not sure it'll end next year. But, despite of pessimistic behavior, I'm hoping that I'm wrong and I wanted to be proved wrong. I'm still hoping it'll end next year, but for now, I'm not sure.",

My kids and I have had a wet cough with congestion (and in my case aches and a temp of 99 for a couple days that the kids didn't get) starting last Friday. I am triple vaxxed, the oldest is double vaxxed as of three weeks ago and my youngest is unvaccinated due to age. I have been testing us all frequently with BinaxNow kits and all tests have been negative except for a very very faint positive for the oldest kid on Wednesday morning. We were all very crushed with Christmas and all but I was also very worried for my kids. However, she took another test today (from the same box the positive test came out of) and to my confusion it was negative again as was mine and the youngest kid. I plan to test her again tomorrow to see what that says. If it turns up negative again, does that mean it could be a false positive?",

We're scheduled for our boosters on Dec 28 (me) and Dec 30 (my parents) and we all either work from home or are retired. I also have school but idk how that will work now. I want to avoid being exposed before then (and maybe for a week or so after) so that I don't get symptoms and have to give up my appointment. So I suggested we go for a nice walk in nature tomorrow instead of the movie, and when we exchange gifts with others outside our household we all wear masks. My parents are planning to go to the movie even if I don't go, so I would still end up getting covid if they picked it up. And my mom is complaining about not wanting to wear a mask with someone in our \"bubble\" (even though my aunt is interacting with her BF and his family as well). I've straight-up told my parents I would resent them if they did end up picking it up (I don't deal with illness well and with the whole having to isolate for over a week thing I know I'd go stir crazy and turn into an absolute monster). Should I isolate in my room as much as possible until I get the booster (it's only a few days)? Or should I just live my life because we're probably going to lock back down here soon anyway?",

We're still here, however close we are to losing our minds, and that's something that's so significant. We've fought our minds and won. Plenty of us (absolutely me included) will be having waves of hopelessness and fear that come and go and recede a little then rear up again and smack us one. And that's alright - what we've been through would definitely class as trauma, especially if you've had difficult circumstances, personal encounters with COVID, or supportive interactions cancelled. We shouldn't expect to feel unscathed after all of that. But no matter how hard it gets, try to remember that there's been plenty of positive studies released about the current situation (which yes, we know they have caveats, but their presence is an amazing positive compared to their absence). Also remember that absolutely everything in life is temporary - you won't feel this way forever. (And even if you don't believe it right now, it's still going to be true regardless.) I know this Christmas will be difficult - bad times can be amplified when you feel like you should be feeling good. But if you can, try to step away from the news for a while (all the stories will still be there when you get back) and do something that makes you happy or switch off from the world - eat good food, talk to someone, play a video game, sleep for twelve hours. Don't be afraid to mope or cry or pretend it's not the holidays, either. But either way, you're gonna get through Christmas, and you're gonna get through the next few months of COVID, and then you're gonna get through whatever comes next, and you'll look back and realise you're so far in the future away from your worst moments and it'll feel like no time has passed at all.

During this interaction yesterday, we were both indoors and wearing masks the entire time. We were within six feet though. I am wondering how long to wait until taking a rapid test I bought last night. It's a hard decision to make because of Christmas plans I had with my girlfriend &amp; loved ones this weekend. It's hard to say if I am either completely fine and protected due to mask + triple vax, or if there is a strong possibility I could catch it, even if the symptoms are mild or not present. Would tomorrow night (about 55-60 hrs after exposure) be too soon for a rapid test? Thanks",

Even some of the less cautious people I know of are starting to not want to hang out as much now. There's been tons of famous people catching covid as well. And in NYC and Florida they're seeing a massive spike in covid cases. In my area (sf bay area) the surge is just starting. But based on what's happening over there it's gonna be pretty bad. I had so much hope that 2022 was gonna be even better than 2021, but now I see no reason to believe that. In fact I have tons of fears than 2022 could be even worse than 2021. During the summer and fall this year I still had a hard time finding the right group to hang out with. And now it looks like it's too late for me to meet new people that I can really connect with. There's even some big concerts and other smaller social gatherings being canceled and moved onto zoom again. I'm especially scared of my therapist doing the same",

He says it helps with his grief which I totally understand. He works as a massage therapist which scares the hell out of me. He's in a small room with a client for 2 hours at a time up-close since that's how massages tend to be. He agreed to suspend his practice in January because of the surge in cases but he's still going to see clients this coming week. I'm pulling my hair out because that's when I think the upcoming surge is going to be at its worst with people spreading it from Christmas gatherings. It drives me crazy to read stuff on here sometimes because I totally understand that, for most of us Covid is not a serious threat. However, my father is in the dangerous age range for this stuff. Every time I see a \"positive\" headline or news story they always throw in the \"except for those over 65\". I'm not worried about myself, I'm worried about him! Now a few things I should point out; * He wears a mask and requires all clients wear one as well, even though his mask is a weird, hand-made tripple-filter carbon filter/ cotton/ silk thing. * He just got his booster mid-November and requires all clients to be vaccinated and postpone sessions if they have traveled on a flight. * I don't want to jinx anything but for 70 he seems very healthy. He's always outside lugging stones and wood around the yard and doesn't have any other health issues that I know of. I just lost my mom and I don't think I could go on if I lost him now. I'm usually pretty optomistic about all the Covid stuff *unless* it relates to my Dad.",

I'm confused about whether to believe them or not - it seems like a good portion of the population will get it eventually and it'll be more like a quick cold than anything, but I'm not sure whether this means EVERY SINGLE PERSON will inevitably catch it sometime in the near future. I've been sick twice over the past two months (not COVID), and it still absolutely sucked for my parents and I to have to wear masks in the house because there's nowhere in our house where I could properly isolate. I really don't want to have to go through that again anytime soon. Plus, my grandpa is 90 years old and if he catches it I'm not sure whether he'd be able to survive, even though he got his booster shot a while ago. We just lost my grandma two months ago and I don't want to lose him so soon too. Can someone help clarify plz??",

I've been stuck in what seems like a time loop without an escape for the last 2 years, what I once thought was a bit of time off from the big city life has turned into 2 years of me essentially living like a sloth. Since then I've sold my flat and put down the deposit for a new one, one that'd be more spacious and perfect fro working from home. The city I used to work in/from is about 1.2k km away and, although I had sort of adjusted to this small village vibe I feel like it's just not who I am, then again I'm also somewhat afraid I won't be able to go back and live life as I once did without my loved ones around me, but I just don't feel like I belong here. Back in the day I at least had the excuse of having to live so far away because of work, but now I feel like I want to go back just because: it wouldn't be going back as much as trying in a way to move forward. Sure I am a bit worried I might catch it, but my appointment for my third jab is in 2 weeks and hopefully after that I'll be able to look at things in a more positive way, there's still a part of me though that dreads the thought of going back and going back to an old me, but I just feel this urge, this pull I'm finding really hard to resist.

I have mostly isolated myself throughout the pandemic, and public places/indoor spaces/seeing friends have been really difficult for me. Omicron has been spreading rapidly in my city and it's raised my covid anxiety to a new level. I feel really anxious about leaving my apartment for any reason. I have to go into the pharmacy on Monday to get my booster shot, but I feel so anxious about catching covid while I am getting vaccinated, and the thought of having to go inside a pharmacy honestly fills me with dread. I know a lot of my covid anxiety is probably intrusive thoughts, but that knowledge doesn't make it any easier to cope with. The anxiety was starting get better in the summer and fall, but it feels like omicron has brought me back to square one. I guess I'm just looking for support and ways to cope with the anxiety of getting my booster shot on monday - both during and after. Beyond double masking, social distancing, and good hygiene, what else can I do to be as safe as possible? Thank you to all",

Most gyms in my area have opened back up with guidelines of \"if you are not vaccinated you need to wear a mask,\" but frankly, I don't trust people to be honest about their status and the BJJ crowd seems like the type to shy away from the vaccine (plus wearing a mask seems worthless in that situation).

Been double vaxxed, got the booster a few days ago and still got it, and today my very vulnerable mum, been all of the above came down with it Weve spent the last two years doing everything right and she still came down with it, and its all my fault. Shes disabled and Im her carer as well as an essential worker and forever Ive been keeping my distance from her, doing everything right and she still came down with it. Right now, as mums do, shes playing it down, even though I can hear her coughing, and shes cold and hot and Ive put Vicks on her and everything else, but this could take her. And Im so scared that I gave her it. Shes downplaying it, but Im terrified and am not dealing well with it. Im feeling ok, a hell of a headache, but nothing to be concerned about right now. Since I was a teenager, Im 42 now Ive had to deal with the fact that due to her issues I could lose her at some point. My dad died from cancer a few years ago, but it came from me. I did this, I feel like my siblings havent said anything but they are blaming me too Anyone else going through this, anyways ways I can stop feeling like this Please",

Its important to know that my parents have two separate places of residence. While I was away at college, my brother started feeling ill and went to go isolate at my moms place. Two days later, I came home from college (staying at my dads place) and my brother tested positive. I wiped down a lot of the commonly used surfaces just in case some viral particles were still there, but at this point, it had been two days since my positive brother was in the house. Five days into his isolation, he decided he wanted to finish it out at my dads place, where I had been staying for the past couple of days. We are physically isolated, as he has a room and bathroom to himself, and whenever I am outside of my room, I wear a mask around the house. Technically, I have not been in any contact with him and have been washing my hands a lot, especially after touching common surfaces, but do exposure rules change now that we are in the same house? Should I be acting like I have been exposed? For further context, I am fully vaccinated and got the booster around a month ago and Im not experiencing any symptoms.",

But still, I fear the inevitable FOMO if my university goes remote for the entire spring semester, while my friends at other universities are still in person. My university wont announce anything until early January as per the update last week, but still what if they say theyll return to in person like after two weeks then extend online learning right after tuition is due? I know alot of people at my university and other ones fear this possibility. More and more universities in the US and Canada are going remote for at least the start of their spring semesters, but theres a growing fear that the entire spring semester goes virtual. Its a tough decision for sure. Do I transfer to avoid a potential remote semester for the sake of my mental health but leave behind all my friends, or do I stay where Im at and be with my friends but at the risk of a remote semester?",

I think he may have been exposed before the trip (between 12/9-12/13). Some of the people he was working with tested positive while we were on our trip. Does that timeline sound about right for him to start experiencing symptoms starting 12/24? He woke up Christmas Eve and felt awful full on symptoms of what I thought to be the flu but with a negative COVID test. The next day, he tested twice both with super faint positive lines. 12/26, the positive line was darker. The only other time he would have been exposed was 12/22 when he was with someone that texted and told him they tested positive. But Im not sure if the onset of the symptoms would have happened that quickly. I guess my real question here is: Has anyone gotten COVID (tested positive and everything) and then gotten a negative test within a few days? Also, has anyone experience getting a false positive test OR anyone know if you can test positive even if its just the flu? I took a test and was negative and am feeling fine. I was sure it was just the flu because I am vaccinated against it and hes not. Lastly, and I know this is a dumb question so dont attack me How soon after he tests negative can I go see him? Were both kind of hoping/holding out for him to be negative by NYE. Super selfish, again, dont attack me. Its just wishful thinking and Im just trying to understand a timeline and hear other peoples experiences. Im curious to know if anyone has gotten over it in a shorter amount of time than others. Hes healthy otherwise and vaccinated (which I know means little at this point). Once he tests negative (even if before the recommended 10 days), if I go see him, is there still a huge risk? \\*\\*His symptoms as of now are: on and off fever, fatigue, GI upset (he threw up once and has had weird stomach stuff sometimes otherwise), stuffy nose (new), cough with green phlegm (getting better), headache, body aches he actually looks and sounds good for being sick. No loss of smell/taste, good appetite, breathing is fine (and no chest pain).",

Of course, that is easy to see considering how Omicron is seemingly mild and we have vaccines in our arsenal, however, I'm curious about what you guys think about the Omicron variant being the \"final\" variant? Of course, I don't think Omicron will actually be the last variant because there WILL be more variants in the future, but hopefully it's when the pandemic finally turns into an endemic where future variants are even far more mild. However, do you guys think it's likely the Omicron could be the final variant that will raise any sort of concern and/or fearmongering from the media? Also, what are the possibilities of a variant far more deadlier than Delta emerging? Just curious, no need to sugar coat anything.",

That said, the new Omicron variant is making its way through the staff of about 6 we have on site. A lot of my co-workers are now out for 2 weeks, and I find myself with all the overtime I could ever want. And just in time, too, because the holiday bills are catching up. 4 of the 6 employees have it, leaving just myself and one night-shift guy. The two of us are the only ones that have been vaccinated. My wife woke up this morning with a headache and fever. Her fever was only 99.8 (just under 100 degrees F). My stepson, a 20-year-old all-knowing anti-vaxxer himself, also had a fever. His was 103, a bit more severe. They both went to get tested, and are both positive. This means I likely have it, or am a carrier. I just took my own temperature, it's 99.2, so yeah - I probably was infected. My question - looking at all of this well-needed overtime, and considering that the entire staff has already been exposed, should I go home and let my manager figure out how to cover these shifts? My vaccination status tells me my symptoms will not be severe, and that seems to be the case so far. I really need the money, and nobody else is likely to get sick except the night-shift guy. Would YOU call your manager, let him know, and give up all that sweet, sweet overtime pay?",

This Christmas I got my booster and my whole family was not sick and fully vaccinated, save for the small children. Yesterday though I got a distressing text from my aunt, saying that one of the kids came back positive from a pcr test from a week ago. Apparently his dad lied that the negative result from the day before we gathered was from a pcr, and actually came from a rapid home test. (Can I add that I hate how inconsistent and unreliable all these tests seem to be?) The kid apparently had some mild symptoms about a week before christmas and promptly got tested, and the doctor didn't think it was covid. Nobody informed us about this. If I had known I wouldn't have taken the chance What's worse, I went to the gathering with some family friends, and they're much more concerned about this, so they wanted everyone to test negative in some capacity. I did with a home test, but that was only a day after the (at the time unaware) exposure. And I feel so guilty and don't know what to say And what's WORSE worse, is I have both a small new years eve hangout at a friend's house and a convention coming up very shortly. I'm trying to find a pcr test, but everywhere is booked solid. I don't have any symptoms, but I'm so devastated. I can miss out on the hangout, but the convention we've pouted a lot of money and planning into. I have no idea where to even go from here",

Am I \"immune\" for 90 days now? Does this mean that if I'm in an environment where someone else tests positive within that time period, I don't have to react? Or would I still have to quarantine before seeing others because I can still infect through the new exposure? Also, when it comes to getting tested for COVID post quarantine, won't I still test positive for up to 3 months on both PCR and rapid? I have 3 of my shots, I got boosted over Thanksgiving.

My question is, my girlfriend really wants me to pick her up. Obviously we both have covid, so that's fine. My concern is, I am really hoping to go back to work next Monday, 7 days from now, If a test later in the week shows I'm negative. If I'm already over the curve, and my lingering symptoms or just general blah, no smell, limited taste, and I bring my girlfriend over who is still knee deep in covid with having cough attacks and throwing up everything she eats or drinks, is this going to mess me up with my test results later in the week? Is this going to prohibit me from going back to work next week? Or will I be good, despite her here, me with just leftover lingering effects that take weeks to dissipate (sense of smell for example) while she's still getting over hurdles? At this point, it's still considered me being exposed and everything, so I couldn't go back to work even if I tested negative, right? Or I mean, I just need clarification here guys",

Come to wake up this morning, and I get the chills, my head aches I even have a cough going on. My Moms also not doing so hot as well. I might get tested, but I think Ive got COVID now. What the fuck??? Why us??? Why did we get it? Why has this pandemic still been going on? Why omnicron? Why new variants overall? Why are the vacccinated now getting it??? And now were seeing Omicrom becoming big, but then Im hearing that South Africa and the UK has been doing better, and that the variant isnt as devastating, but Im not so sure. How are they doing better under a not so bad variant when Im now hearing that hospitals are getting towards overcapacity. Why do I we still feel icky and nasty under this better variant??? What if I have long-COVID now despite my efforts? Im getting really scared, Im angry (Im fucking vaccinated, this shouldnt be happening), and Im confused. Has anyone else gotten omicron? Will we be OK? Whats going on?",

I had a breakthrough covid case in early August (he somehow didn't catch it). I realize that doesn't mean you shouldn't get a shot (just sharing for background). We are both young and pretty healthy: exercise regularly, eat well, no conditions to note. I work from home full time, and so does my husband, so we aren't exposed to many people in our day-to-day lives. We live in the US and were invited to a wedding abroad in February (if it still happens - the couple has postponed three times already and are very eager to move forward). It sounds like booster protection wanes in about 10 weeks. Even before that had come out, we discussed if we should hold off on our booster until 2-3 weeks before our trip so our protection will be at its strongest. That would put us at mid-January for the optimal shot timing, so just a couple of weeks from now. I don't know - it seems kind of like we're making up our own rules, but it could also be a good idea? At the same time there's so much unknown: What if institutions start mandating boosters? What if we get omicron before we can get our boosters? Are we being stupid about this?",

Then out of nowhere I had a serious round of diarrhea and an hour later vomited a few times. Over the 18th - 21st I continued feeling achy, temperature fluctuated and I was extremely sweaty but didn't feel any worse off than any \"normal\" flu. Earliest I could get covid swabbed was on Dec 21st and my test came back negative. My wife didn't have Amy symptoms in through this or on the Dec 21 swab date but also got covid swabbed and the result was negative. Now we both have a nasty residual cough and now my in-laws who I live with have sore throats and have been coughing. The entire house has been fully vaccinated and my wife and I also had covid back in April 2020. Could I at this point presume we had it again? I've also been waking up with what appears to be pink eye every 3rd day or so as well so I mean I think ive covered the list. As a side note how would you advise calming down a very scared spouse? When my wife had it back in 2020 she was hospitalized and still has ptsd from it so with how transmissable omicron is she is freaking out. Any help is appreciated. Stay safe everyone I really appreciate you all. I've been here and there on this sub since it all went down for us the year and a half ago and you have been a great support to me.",

We will know for sure in about 2 weeks, with the surge just starting, but so far it's looking like it's by far the mildest variant so far. Up to this point we'd been (somewhat) suppressing Covid through measures, the vaccine, and immunity gained from having Covid which put an evolutionary pressure on Covid to mutate once again so it can become effective again. If this truly ends up being as mild as the seasonal Flu, shouldn't we encourage this one to be the one that embeds into our society? Until we figure out anti-viral science entirely, isn't that the best we can do? I genuinely fear that being too effective against Omicron might end in a worse variant taking on the pressure, which is what we don't want. I know that this kind of thinking might sound weird though, which is why I'm asking it here.",

I have received some positive response, but also negative response. The response tends to range from \"It's only comparatively better to dying,\" to \"You're selfish for being anti-science and you will kill somebody.\" I've found that some people I know enjoy mentioning their ultra-compliance to self-imposed COVID restrictions and lauding anybody they see not wearing a mask outside when not even close to anyone else. It's like when the anti-mask, anti-vax crowed politicized the virus they made it entirely necessary for anyone opposite them on the political spectrum to adopt eternal draconian COVID tenets as a part of their political identity. Then we have the crowd that never really enjoyed seeing people anyway and have been looking forward to a global catastrophe like this to spur our transition from living life in person to living life virtually in perpetuity. A pandemic ends once everyone is on board with it having ended. If the next mutation literally was a cold I have no doubt that everyone would be pissed at the CDC to say so, there would still be a lot of people (especially social media influencers chasing clout by spouting extremized rhetoric to an impressionable audience) saying that it is selfish to socialize when the virus is still with us, we need to continue to blame others for the virus still being around, you need to wear your mask everywhere, etc. I'm building a strawman, I know, but it is a hypothetical not entirely without some experience to back it up. So all that said, things are eventually going to get better. Is everybody going to be able to accept when it does?

Last night, I watched a Lord of the Rings movie with my son and it finished after midnight. As I tried to walk upstairs, I thought I might have to ask for help. My legs were just weak and my knees hurt, a lot. I woke up in the middle of the night, shivering uncontrollably to the point where working the buttons on the oven and letting out the dog was like working with Parkinson's disease - shaky, shaky. That seems to have passed, but my nose is stuffy, my eyes are burning, I ache all over, to touch my skin hurts, I am nauseous, and have a headache. I've taken Tylenol, but does anyone have any other tips for getting over the hump? I am trying to WFH today, but everything hurts and I just want to lie down and not move. In spite of that, I am happy to have been able to get a booster, which are in pretty tight supply at the moment. I am especially glad to be boosted because omnicron variant is all around me. I bailed on our family dinner on Christmas because the original plan was for 18 people and Public Health had just mandated no gatherings of more than 10 people. I pulled out my family of 5 and they were still planning on going ahead with an illegal number of attendees, 13, and everyone was pushing us to attend. I held firm and I am glad I did, because the dinner was cancelled last minute when the hosts were made aware they were close contacts of a known infection. Having been exposed, they are now quite ill. I am so ready for Covid to be in the past...",

Epidemiologists such as Michael Mina have criticized the CDC's neglect of rapid antigen testing as an indicator of whether someone should end isolation (NOT the PCR test, which continues to give false positives for months after someone has COVID). The UK has implemented something similar recently. I'm thinking of requiring people who test positive to isolate for 5 days, get an antigen test on the 5th day, and leave isolation if the test comes back negative (still masked up until the 10th day), but I'm worried about false positives from antigen testing. Does anyone know how well rapid antigen tests indicate infectiousness? Scientific sources would be very much appreciated.",

She was at a Christmas Eve family event where everyone was supposed to be vaccinated and symptom free, but someone brought her young daughter who \"had a cold\" and surprise surprise, its COVID. She was unmasked the whole time. My friend got a rapid test Tuesday which was negative, still waiting on PCR results. She doesn't have any symptoms. We are both boosted, and I live alone but I am somewhat high risk. Do you think it's safe to hang out? Since there are so many breakthrough cases with omicron and false negatives with tests I'm feeling nervous about it. Pretty much my whole family has gotten COVID in the past month, my mom just got out of the hospital. I'm just bummed because I have been looking forward to seeing her for months.",

I'm tentatively planning to spend the weekend (the evening of the 31st through the morning of the 2nd) at a friend's place for a small (eight-person) NYE gathering. We're all vaccinated, boosted, and have been isolating as best as we can for the week leading up to it, and we're all going to rapid test shortly before entering. Because I'm currently living with my parents, both of whom are a little older (72 and 64), I'm planning on isolating myself in an Airbnb afterwards until the morning of the 5th so that hopefully enough time will have passed so that I'll know whether or not I have it, be it through symptoms or the lack thereof, as well as a rapid test. My question is: given all of this, does four and a half days past the potential exposure point sound like a reasonable isolation time before going back to my parents' place? My parents aren't stressed about my plan at all--they're both vaxxed and boosted--but I just want to have all my bases covered, and was a little confused about the incubation time. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",

She knows the pandemic will end. But she says \"you can still optimistic, but you need to do it cautiously.\" I guess I said the pandemic won't end next year and keep losing hope because I'm confused. I just wanted the pandemic to end badly, so we can go back to normal lives. I even talk to my Dad that I think the 2020s will be the worst decade, but he said \"As long as it's not like World War I or World War 2, we're okay.\" So I guess keep losing hope, because I just don't understand.

        "Reddit Post": "I first showed symptoms of what the nurses think was Delta on 12/6, had about a week of cold/gastro symptoms, then a week of feeling like hell, even though it's technically still a mild case. Got the monoclonal antibodies on day 8 and it helped to turn things around. Since folks might ask, I'm 30F, technically obsese BMI, no major pre-existing symptoms aside from borderline high blood pressure/anxiety. However now I'm on week 4 and still feeling weird. Like my heart is still beating erratically at times, I'm having brain fog to the point where I don't remember how do to simple things, I'm thinking slow, depersonalization, depression, and mood swings. I can't sleep, and 3am feels like it might as well be 3pm. I just don't feel like myself. I still have weird nerve sensations in my arms and face and legs. I still get out of breath just walking my dog. I'm just now starting to get taste back but unfortunately everything tastes bad, like sewage, which is almost worse than not being able to taste at all. I'm so incredibly frustrated. I feel so...dumb and tired and its exhausting. I can't see a doctor for another month as they are so backlogged. My question is for anyone else who has gone through this was there anything that helped you get through it? I feel like I'm going crazy and I'm not myself. Any supplements or therapy you can recommend would be helpful. It's frustrating to see people say it's just a cold and are over it in 3 days when I'm still struggling with simple tasks. I'm more determined than ever to lose extra weight since I'm sure that's a contributing factor but I'm hoping there's a light at the end of this tunnel. Thanks!",

I don't see people but I don't know if this being so transmisable that maybe even I'll end up getting it through a surface. The isolation is killing me mentally but the cases are so so so high where I am idk what to do. I'm drained and losing hope.",

Now that I am vaccinated, I would like to know if there are any general rules or ways to decide what things I should or shouldn't do, particularly with the new variants, such as the Omicron variant going around. I am 21 years old and am not in an at-risk group, and I live with mother and grandparents, who got vaccinated with the <ORG> vaccine last year. &amp;#x200B; 1. Can I, for example, play table tennis without me or my coach wearing a mask? I play indoors, it's a small space that is empty most of the time and my coach is vaccinated. But unvaccinated people could walk in the table tennis area any time. 2. Do I still need to wash my hands for 60 seconds every time I receive a package at our house, or would that be overkill? 3. We have a walking area where I live, most people there don't wear masks and I don't know if they are vaccinated, would it be safe for me to go and walk amidst them while wearing a mask? 4. Is it safe for me to go to restaurants? 5. I read that the protection from the vaccine wanes over time. If it is safe for me to go out, assuming that I can't get a booster, how long is it safe before the protection will decrease to the point where I need to stay home, and avoid going out again? 6. Should I isolate everytime I feel feverish or get a fever, or everytime I meet someone, and later find out that they got a fever? 7. Should I be worried about long covid, I read a [post]([url] here about a vaccinated person who got brain fog after getting COVID, should I be worried about this? 8. Are there any general rules or things to keep in mind to help me make these decisions? Like before the vaccine, there were guidelines such as maintaining a distance of six feet and avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands for 20/60 seconds, avoiding being indoors with other people when possible, etc. I'm not sure what precautions I can stop taking and which ones are still very important.

And the thing is even if this does \"end\" anytime soon (I have a hard time believing it will before 2024) there's gonna be some other disaster, prolly climate related, that's gonna make the next \"era\" feel like hell too. It was the same for most of my life, either something was terrible personally or politically and there was no true peace. So should I just assume things are going to stay like this for a long time and plan my future based on that? I've been putting things \"on hold\", should I just be changing those plans entirely at this point? Please only respond if you have information on any of this, the \"I feel the same way\" comments honestly just make me feel sadder and more worried.

They both tested positive today but I ended up being negative even though I was with them. Im staying with my mom now, but I apparently cannot stop crying and worrying about them. I struggle to even brush off the thought of them passing when Im not around. I know it was best for me to be away from them for the time being, but its just difficult to see them in such a different way from their usual healthy selves. Both of them exercise very regularly: my dad is 52 and my sister is 14. My sister has not gotten the booster of course due to her age, but my dad refuses to get it. This part has worried me since the beginning; he does not see the point of getting vaccinated and he frequently goes out. To make things worse, his job requires close contact with people and he relies too much on his immune. Ive tried so many times but I have no idea what else I can do. He doesnt like to listen, but he would usually hear me out if I start crying(according to my sister). I had already left his place in tears leaving him confused, and I am wondering if Im being over dramatic about this. Im glad theyre both choosing to take more precautions and take it more seriously, but I just want them to get better. When I try to look up news/information, I become more overwhelmed and confused as to how deadly this virus/variant is and where we are as a country. And I keep worrying about whether my dads age will affect him too much and how possible is it for both of them to have a good recovery. I understand this is not just your common sickness, but I just cant stop worryingI never knew I would feel this way, especially when winter break was supposed to be relaxing for all of us.",

But by the night time it was all gone and i almost thought i am symptom free. Because i literally had no symptoms left and my appetite also got better which resulted in me eating a nice meal instead of eating just a piece of bread all day every 5 hours. Anyways today on day 2 all of the symptoms came back.The fever,chils,body aches, and the sore throat is so insane and worse than ever since i got covid. As of writing this post the fever looks good again but the sore throat is killing me and my appetite has gone down again. Fever is something that comes and goes every 4,5 hours but sore throat is pretty much there and got worse actually.Is the sore throat normal while recovering? thanks",

For starters I will share what I will be doing 1. I will unsub to r/coronavirus therefore making this subreddit my only subscription. I feel like removing all the overreacting media articles and the bad news off my reddit feed will be great plus all the trolls on there that want this pandemic to last forever. 2. Second I will keep the global vaccination tracker as a temporary tab on my computer to check daily. If we are going to end this we must end it globally. Going into 2022 with both these changes will make me feel good throughout the year and hopefully we will all reach pandemics end. This also means I will be 100% active on this sub only. The coronavirus sub is seriously something else. Feel free to share your covid changes for the new year.",

I have some pretty severe health anxiety so obviously the pandemic has been a literal nightmare for me (as I am sure it has been for everyone else, regardless lol). I finally got a job I love and had to bite the bullet of being in contact with strangers and handling money etc. Until boxing week (its fucking MENTAL during boxing week where I work) I had actually felt very good about rona and felt very confident that I was safe- then I was surrounded by people in an at capacity store for 10+ hours for almost a week straight and got anxious. Fast forward one co worker has tested positive and now my sister has as well (unrelated to my place of work, she and her roommate caught it from someone over Christmas). Im honestly very nervous and people all around me keep talking about omicron and how all of us are just getting it left and right. It feels so close to home and Im worried for my sister (not in an at risk group and is double vaxxed although not boosted yet). I myself am also double vaxxed but not boosted. Anyways, Im rambling but I guess I just needed to vent it out since I have to somehow get sleep tonight before I go back into work tomorrow for the last couple of days before boxing week ends. Like everyone else, Im just so tired of covid and sick of being so anxious and aware of it 24/7. Hope everyone else is doing okay &lt;3",

My mental health has been deteriorating recently with the surge in cases and the vaccination status of my parents. I love them, but they have been making questionable choices throughout this pandemic. They were great when the pandemic started, being supportive and taking precautions, but ever since the vaccine came out they've turned full on anti-vax and are now spouting nonsense about how covid is a hoax. They refuse to get vaccinated and are even planning on flying to Florida in late January for a vacation. I've tried to be understanding and voiced my concerns, never trying to force anything, but no matter what it seems like I'll have to accept that they continue to believe what they believe. Most recently I cancelled my Christmas plans with them due to a covid exposure I got and it's been nothing but guilt tripping from them trying to tell me how I'm overreacting and that we should be spending the holidays together. I've accepted that I can't change their mind and can't control their lifestyle, but my mental health has taken a plunge due to my worry for them cause at the end of the day I do love them. Has anyone in a similar situation found a good way to deal with the anxiety and stress? I'm trying to distract myself with hobbies and my puppy but it's just so hard these days.",

I live in the sf bay area which has been frustrating because we're super strict about covid which has made making friends much more difficult. Yet even though we're doing everything right we're still having record breaking cases. Things are getting canceled again just like March 2020. And more people are now less willing to meet new people or even people they already know. Over the summer and fall I tried going to meetup groups to meet new people and I never could really find the right group of people. And now it looks like I'll have to wait till the summer to even be able to try and find new friends again. I spoke to my therapist about my struggles to find people I can connect well with and she told me because I'm not willing to do zoom calls I'm probably not gonna get anywhere towards making new friends for a long time. And one of my closest friends got upset at me for going to EDC Orlando last month and going to Disneyland with my mom last week. I was scared to even post that I went to edc Orlando a month ago because my friend wouldn't approve of it. I still have a super hard time convincing myself that 2022 will be any better. Or that if I lost my life I would be missed by other people. I also fear that people will be even less willing to go back to normal post omicron because of trauma from getting sick with covid.",

My friends have been the opposite. They're a couple with a young child (4, m) and I think they recently went to a party in a neighboring country and when they came home they had all been infected. They didn't seem to bothered by it. When we asked what kind of party it was they said it was wedding but I know they don't know any people in that country close enough to be invited to a wedding. During COVID! Can I just broach the subject directly? How would you do it?",

Since then, he has been experiencing chest pain, dizziness, almost lost consciousness a few times, and shortness of breath. Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.",

I decided to get tested that same day and got my results about 36hrs later, and it was negative. At the time, I was pretty fatigued and I felt like I was going to fall asleep during dinner and I had a weird slimy feeling in my throat, so nothing major. These \"symptoms\" haven't really changed, so I decided to test myself yesterday with an antigen rapid test kit and it came out positive. So what should I even believe? The PCR test results was 3 days after the gathering, and the Antigen Rapid Test kit I did was yesterday. One could be false positive and the other one could be false negative. Should I assume the Rapid Test kit is wrong since I always hear they are inaccurate? Regardless, I'm still quarantining myself for 2 weeks.",

I (24 F, 3X vaxxed) went a family gathering on 12/24 (my first family event since COVID began), started feeling sick on 12/26. By 12/27 I had a full-blown sore throat, fever, chills, &amp; difficulty breathing. Standing to do dishes became impossible. Found out on 12/29 that *4* family members (of maybe 15 total in attendance) had tested positive since the gathering, all starting to feel sick on 12/26 as well, &amp; they happen to be the ones I spent the most time near. At this point, my symptoms change every day - today is headache, trouble breathing, runny nose, etc. I've had pretty much every symptom except loss of taste or smell. Testing kits are non-existent where I live at this point. Earliest testing appt. was 12/29 for a PCR test through Project Baseline (Rite-Aid) &amp; I received my results this evening - negative for COVID. At first I was relieved, but I'm having a hard time believing that what I'm experiencing is anything but COVID when A) I was in an environment where somebody was clearly infectious &amp; in close contact with family, &amp; B) I've never felt an illness quite like this in my life. Seriously, everything feels like an effort! I've never quite struggled to breathe like this (Also, negative for flu) The earliest testing appointment anywhere near me is 1/6. I intend on testing again but have little hope for answers, honestly, thinking this is pretty far out from exposure date. How should I interpret this negative result? Am I super paranoid or was the time frame in which I got tested too soon/late? All thoughts welcome!",

About 3 weeks ago my husband (m31) tested positive for Covid. He was very low on energy and slept ALOT for about a week. Finally, we noticed his oxygen saturation was dropping off and on. On day 7 of him being positive, his oxygen saturation dropped to 83. So, we had him sent to the hospital via ambulance. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days. After a day and a half he was bumped from 5 liters of oxygen to a heated high flow 50 liters. He stayed on that for about 3 days and then they slowly decreased. He was discharged about a week ago, but he still has to use oxygen when he sleeps and sometimes throughout the day. His PCP says he needs to stick with it for at least another month. My husband is very determined to stop using it as much and he is pushing himself. I understand he doesnt want to use it forever, but his doctor says it will take one day at a time. I am hopeful that he will be able to come off of it soon, but I fear that my husband is rushing it. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!",

Since it's pretty hot over here, we thought It was a heatstroke until we did a covid test on her. Low and behold, she tested positive. My aunt also developed a cough last night and her baby daughter developed a fever today. I'm fully vaccinated and after days of being all around them and constantly exposed to it, I tested negative today while they tested positive. I'm fully vaccinated and actually had my run with covid March 2020 where the only thing I had was lost of taste and smell. I'm in a bit in a pickle right now because I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to wear a mask 24/7 in the place I'm staying at right now and my mom's insisting that since I've been exposed to it already, and tested negative that I'll be fine. I fly out by myself back home to cali on the 5th and really don't want to catch it so close to the time I'm leaving. My question is, what's the likelihood that I can still catch it if I haven't all this time? If they all have gotten symptoms around the same time, that means that that the incubation period started at the same time, which means either for some reason I somehow avoided it after all this time traveling and being together (unlikely), or I already had it before without knowing and that's why I tested negative. What do I do lol",

I have an immune disorder but I was more afraid of giving them Covid because of the worse outcomes for unvaxxed that I tested myself beforehand to make sure I was negative. I had been just ignoring their medical stupidity and political opinions for the past 2 years, justifying it as they are family and I cant control them and their decisions. Of course, on the 28th my stepmom and my BIL (who is vaxxed &amp; boosted) both tested positive - unclear when their symptoms started. I tested PCR positive on the 31st (after 2 negative home tests). My dad refused to quarantine and doesnt wear a mask at work (hes in customer service). I cant say with 100% certainty that they gave it to me but its more likely than not one of them did. Even if they didnt, I think Im more upset that my dad didnt quarantine. He sent me a long-winded text about how hes disappointed in me for choosing the path Im on (Im a PhD student, so that stings) and how we are, and I quote, diametrically opposed politically and in social values. I dont want to discuss politics here, but I need support in knowing how to respond. We obviously have different values and I dont know what that means for a parent/child relationship as adults. I have children so I hate the thought of separating them from their grandparents, but I also feel like they brought this on themselves by not getting vaccinated - and moreover, not caring about spreading it to others. Its one thing to risk your own life, its another to risk others. I am hoping that my symptoms stay relatively mild, given my immune disorder, but I regret risking my health to see them when they dont even care to do the bare minimum. Any advice? :(",

And now I'm so scared I will have to do the same, but still trying to be positive and manifest a good outcome. The day before Christmas, my own dad tested positive for covid, had typical cold symptoms, said he felt fine otherwise. I bought him an oximeter and yesterday he started feeling worse and his blood oxygen level was at 42% so I brought him to the hospital. He called me and sounded so scared and confused and asked me to come pick him up and bring him to the hospital. His healthcare team said it's an extreme case of covid and there is a high probability that he may be intubated. If he maxes out on the oxygen through his cannula, he will move to CPAP, and then to a vent. The doctor said he's now at a point where patients typically start to gradually improve, or take a sharp decline and have to end up on a vent, which has a 50% mortality rate for my dad's age. Thankfully his oxygen level is staying above 90% while he's got the cannula in and is thinking more clearly, etc. It could really go either way right now. I can't go see him, he can't really talk on the phone, I couldn't even wait with him in the ER waiting room. Just had to hug him real quick, tell him I love him, and then leave. Anyone else been here or had a family member in this position? Any tips to help him not panic to keep his breathing steady? Any tips for me and what I should be asking the doctors, etc? He is unmarried and I am the eldest child. I just can't imagine losing my father so young. He is only 50 and I am 26. Could use some words of encouragement and positive recovery stories.",

For instance, my parents were not so afraid when the lockdowns started again in their area, or when they contracted Delta although they were double jabbed. My friends just laughed it off when lockdown was implemented again in my country 2 weeks ago, and just made jokes about what they're gonna do during the lockdown. My brother remains focused on his uni assignments and exams despite omicron surge in his area and the threat that he may not be able to come back home for holiday due to stricter travel restrictions from the home country. On the other hand, here I was ruminating about how much money I would lose if I had to cancel the trip and whether I'll ever see my parents again, worrying everyday thinking this might be the day we go back to lockdown (and indeed that day happened), and a myriad of other things related to this bullshit. I'd like to ask them how they are not afraid, but I'm ashamed to reveal to them that I'm so weak mentally. I'm also afraid of being offended that they would downplay my anxiety. It's as if they don't have feelings. Sometimes I feel like I would kill just to have a little of their nonchalance or peace of mind. It's as if even if world war 3 happens, they wont give a damn. I really wish I could engineer my heart to be like that. Anyone on the same boat?",

I didn't have a fever as a side effect for any of the doses. But I will say dose three did make my body sore. I had lots of aches, headache, and stiffness. I took advil extra strength, I know tylenol is recommended but I went with advil because it works better on me for pain relief. No fever and no nausea, just body pain and tiredness. I also couldn't really think straight due to the discomfort. So I just sat and did nothing the whole day until I felt better. It's day two, and I feel good.

I am getting help for it, but covid has pushed me so far back when I was making leaps and bounds in my progress. I have not had covid (or even a cold) since the pandemic started, and am triple vaxxed. Same for my partner. Omicron has sent me into an awful spiral, because it seems inevitable. My partner has been in a few grocery stores this past week, I have been absolutely nowhere except to walk my dog and do laundry in our shared laundry area (I work from home). Today my partner said they werent feeling well, took their temp and it was 99.3. They said they are feeling run down and a little sick and laid down to take a nap. Im in a complete panic. I feel like I could throw up and my chest is tightening. I know how ridiculous this probably seems, but I cannot relax. I dont know what the point of this post really is, but I could use support. Im so scared covid has finally caught up with us. It also doesnt help that we cant get a test ANYWHERE.",

I tested positive on Dec 14th, 20 days ago. After being cleared by my university on the 24th, I went to Europe to meet my family after a negative antigen from CVS. I lived my life like I had no fear of getting it anytime soon; nothing crazy just went to a small bar a couple of nights. Come Jan 1st, and I wake up with a slightly stuffy nose. Later that night, my sister, who I spent every second of the trip, tested positive for covid. After that moment I became extremely worried that my congestion was covid and it only got worse with flying back. I tested on the 2nd after my flight and my antigen came back positive. I freaked out. Can I have it again after only getting it 20 days ago, or is it just a false positive? Extra concerned as my antigen test on the 24th was negative and now my at-home one is positive. My congestion is now a bit worse, but I have no other symptoms like I did when I had covid for sure. Thank you in advance for any input you have!",

Immediately upon finding this out i took a rapid test and it was negative, and then today i took a PCR and am waiting for results. My mother with whom i'm staying with is severely immunocompromised (like had open heart surgery a year ago and one of her lungs doesnt work properly). So despite having been in in very close contact with her i am now distancing from her and everyone else in the house and wearing a mask. Then, today we discovered that a family member who was here on the 1st just tested positive on a rapid test today. So, i have a couple of questions cause we're all kind of freaking out right now. 1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)? 2) It is even possible for me to have transmitted covid to this family member who was here on the first? If i was carrying it, my time of contact with the virus would have been only 4 days prior. Is this enough time for me to have then transmitted it to someone else? 3) What exactly is safe to do in my house? Right now i am confining myself to either my bedroom (mask off) or in an adjacent bonus room (with a mask on). This room is fairly large, and a couple of people in the house pass through it a few times a day, generally passing about 15-20 feet away from me. How likely is it that i can pass the virus to them while being in this room, with a mask on? Thanks, appreciate any help i can get. Note: everyone in my family has 2 vaccines, my mother has had 3. Exactly how at risk of hospitalization/death is she? We're all deeply concerned.",

I'm constantly trying to make sense why we're one of the only countries in full lockdown, and it seems at least partially due to our low ICU (critical care) capacity, meaning the potential for our hospitals to become overwhelmed is far higher than in other countries. Now, I've clung to the hope that pandemics in the end will end once enough people have contracted the virus / become vaccinated, but the following article worries me a bit: [[url] It says that getting the viruss reproductive number down to one is just the bare minimum for earning the endemic classification (instead of a pandemic), and the moment it stops being a threat will differ per country and depends on factors like hospital / ICU capacity. So since we had kind of a healthcare crisis even before the pandemic, I'm very worried that we might be stuck with restrictions way longer than other countries. Even before covid, in 2018 we had to postpone some operations due to a heavy flu season. The government planning \"long term strategies\" where we will indefinitely move large gatherings to the summer and \"stay low\" during the winter doesn't help either... Can anyone give some reassurance / thoughts? TLDR; I'm worried the problem with limited critical care in the Netherlands will keep us from moving beyond this crisis",

As a result, I have over time lost all other relationships with family and friends. Now, with the virus being utterly unavoidable, they will die and I will be left alone.

Not knowing if I would have to give birth alone or the hospital would take away my baby. We were in strict lockdown up until my husband and I could be vaccinated. We didn't go inside anywhere. I cried every day last winter. My son is very social and loves people and I couldn't give that to him. He would smile ear to ear at doctor appointments because he could finally see someone that wasn't my husband or me. Over the summer we started doing thing again, it was great. My son was so happy. We did something every day. We would walk around stores, grocery shop, eat out, and go to swim lessons. But it August with delta we started to self lock down again. Back to crying every day and trying to entertain a social toddler. Fast forward to the news that vaccines are actually a long ways away. I lost it mentally. Went full \"fuck it\" mode. Even with the massive surge going on right now. I started doing things again. Going to malls just to walk around with my son, going out to eat, and meeting with friends and family even if they do risky things. I'm pretty sure we haven't gotten sick yet. We all had a cold 3 weeks ago but tested negative on rapid tests so who knows. I'm just defeated. So this is my confession. I'm a bad parent and putting my son at risk. I don't have what it takes to entertain him at home. He loves saying hi to people he walks by. He smiles the entire time. He loves joining groups of kids and starts interacting with out missing a beat. I want to know what it's like being a parent with out being on the verge of a panic attack all the time or the massive guilt. And if I do stay in I'm not giving him that social interaction that he craves. I don't know, I just wanted to get all of this off my chest.",

I live in a southern state that does little to nothing in the university system to mitigate the spread of COVID. Up until this point I have not gotten it by wearing a mask in class despite being one of the only ones to do so and limiting my time on campus. That being said, last semester I somehow got mono and missed 4 weeks of school due to having post viral fatigue and also battled a kidney infection at the same time. The stress that put on me in terms of making up my schoolwork was crazy. I was thinking that maybe just maybe this semester COVID would die down even more but the transmission rate along with the new guidlines on isolation just seem like a recipe for disaster in an environment when people already dont care. In addition one of my classes is 3 hours long. Thats a long time to be exposed to people. I understand that its basically inevitable Im going to get it and whatever Im just feeling dissapointed and hopeless and dont want the stress of being sick to take me down again. Im also just frustrated that everyone seems to have given up on trying to control COVID even just a little bit. I know Im healthy otherwise and I wouldnt probably be severely ill due to be vaccinated and boosted its just annoying how it seems everyone has resigned to it.",

The moment I stepped into my tiny studio I started crying hysterically, and I haven't stopped crying every few hours since. Yesterday I found out my sister , who I spent a lot of time with, tested positive. And then I started getting sick. I'm pretty sure I have COVID and the testing tommorow will likely confirm that. And I'm so scared , not as much about being sick but the isolation. It feels like somebody ripped out a chunk of my heart and Im overwhelmed by everything. Schools starting again and I have assignments to do, I'm so hungry, and I need my meds renewed, but all I can think of is how scared I am of being alone. I think I got traumatized by past instances of being alone during lockdown and I emotionally can't do it this time around. There's also a curfew which makes things even worse. I can't even distract myself with TV or movies, I feel no desire to do anything. On top of that many of my friends are suicidal and I'm so so scared that I'll lose someone. I live in Quebec and everything is so fucked, I feel completely trapped and the walls are closing in on me. This cycle of being able to live on my own= there being another lockdown = having a mental breakdown and moving in with my parents = moving back out to the city I normally live in , makes me feel like nothing will ever improve. I have a pet who needs me to care for him but I can't, I'm struggling and I need help. Please if anyone is going through the same thing or knows some tips to cope please help, I feel like I can't breathe and idk how much longer I can do this,",

I know I don't have control over government travel closures, and can't 100% prevent exposure without ridiculous measures. I just want to not have covid in late February. What measures would you take if it were you? The situation: * I live with two roommates, both vaxxed + boosted + healthy * One of my roommates will be returning from flight-based travel 1 week before I need to test negative * That same roommate frequently attends bars and concerts. In our home state, all bars and concerts are vax-only, but that isn't the case in the area he will be visiting. This may be negotiable with sufficient advance notice and a sufficiently small time box - like I can't ask him to quit all concerts until then, but I can ask him to skip for a week while he isn't visiting friends * We live in a city with free PCR and RT-qPCR testing. Right now RT-qPCR appointments are available 7-30 days in advance. Full PCR is far less convenient but we can still get advance appointments. * I'm willing to drop money on at-home tests if they are likely to help * Our area should be past our Omicron peak by then, but not by much",

The few that were walk-ins had wait times of like 4-6hours. But of course it's been recently switched to only be available to those working in places like healthcare, longterm care, etc. So I'm totally out of luck. Up until yesterday I had a headache, painfully dry nose/sinuses, a sore throat, and fatigue. No coughing, my temperature was 37C (on average I'm around 36.5), I'm eating fine. As of today I'm a lot better and really only dealing with some congestion. I'm just so frustrated that I have no way to find out if it's actually Covid. But also, the officials keep changing the guidelines so I have no idea what the rules are anymore. Luckily I'm Work from Home, and although I'm back visiting my dad (been back almost a month), his place is big enough I can still sufficiently quarantine, which I've been doing since Thursday. I just hate not knowing for sure. Even when looking online, due to the new Omicron, the possible symptoms are all over the place.",

I've had three vaccinations (all <ORG> for the first two and booster) and before the whole Omicron thing I was starting to finally relax and was enjoying university and all the freedom was going to clubs etc and felt protected and safe in my university environment and around my friends. Since I left uni for Christmas so many of my friends have tested positive (there was an outbreak amongst my friend group just before I left and I was in close contact with 8 of them however I didn't catch it myself) and more and more people I know are catching it everyday. I'm in a sports society and they're already talking about going to clubs when the term starts so I feel like when I go back I'm going to almost 100% catch it either from my sports team, from my friends or just in general from being in a packed uni environment. Everyone I know at uni is double vaccinated but only a few have had the booster. I just want to enjoy university life but this threat of catching covid is just looming over my head like some kind of inevitable fate. I don't know what to do because the only other option is to drop out of uni and become a house mouse which would make my mental health suffer as I'm extremely extroverted. I'm not so afraid of catching covid and having a mild illness I'm TERRIFIED of this then turning into long covid and being basically permanently disabled for the rest of my life (the brain fog symptoms scare me the most).

The only reason I know it's going around is because two of the people who previously had it told me. There is one case in particular that likely exposed people the week before Christmas and our boss never thought to inform us so we can get tested before seeing loved ones during the holidays. And now there have been two more cases since that. I understand not being able to say who has it, but I think it is negligent to not alert us of the threat in general. I honestly feel betrayed, disrespected, and scared. I plan to talk to my boss about my feelings on this - I'd like to ask for better COVID policies, but she doesn't take the pandemic seriously, so I'm worried it won't go well. Any advice on what I can say or perhaps legal/OSHA verbiage I can refer to to assist my case?",

I also have no symptoms. I am wondering how are you managing or how did you manage a household where some tested negative for COVID and others tested positive? Did you clean everyday? Did everyone wear masks? Friends say that one of us should stay at motel/hotel.

I am not an anti vaxxer, I do believe in science and my kids have all their vaccins up to date. I have concerns that I would like to share so people can help me take a decision. Our government made a vaccin passport and we cannot go to restaurants or do interior activities without it. I consider myself a very responsible citizen and I would like your opinions in a polite manner. I am here to have clearer thoughts. My main concerns are: 1. I dont feel the obligation since we dont have any known health issues and we do not live or work with old people. 2. We all got what we think is covid before tests were available (jan-feb 2020) I had all the symptoms including loss of smell and taste and it was the worst flu of my life. I never got that sick in my entire 35 years. Husband and kids less than me. All my surroundings were very sick. My nurse friend said at the clinic they has lots of unknown cases, doctor couldnt figure out what it was.. and antibiotics didnt work. So many people got it. 3. I wear my mask and keep social distancing and whatever my Quebec (canada) government is asking. Even though I do not follow their logic because of their lack of transparency and open debate. 4. Lots of scientiste, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, are against what is happening and the obligation to get vaccinated. So I do have a trust issue I never get my news from facebook or social media. I do know how to read scholarly articles. 5. Lets not lie about the fact that pharmaceutical companies are getting richer 6. Vaccins have to fo through many years of testings (5-7) so I am scared about long term effect 7. In Israel they started the 4th shot so vaccin is not fixing the problem?! 8. It is going to be an endemic and we all know the virus is here to stay Thank you for your guidance Sometimes we just need to hear the right things to know that whats the right thing to do.",

For my second I was really sick for 3 days with what I describe as a combination of the flu and an awful hangover (103.5 fever, chills, aches, headache, nausea etc). Because of this I have been hesitant getting the booster shot. I got an antibody test couple weeks ago, right before the holidays. To my shock my antibodies are still &gt; 2500. To my knowledge I have never contracted covid. I was exposed on Christmas, I tested negative, but my wife tested positive. Had another test 5-6 days after second exposure and tested negative again. I felt fine throughout the week I was exposed from my wife and before that as well. Considering all of this, I'm thinking of waiting until they come out with a new booster that includes new variants. I don't want to go through getting that sick again without an added benefit. Any thoughts?",

I follow the recommendations and do my best to live my life. We needed some car work done yesterday. The shop was nice enough to drive the vehicle back to the house (10-15 minute drive plus they had to drive to diagnose) but now Im having a bit of a panic about driving it. They werent masked and its been so long since Ive shared a vehicle with anyone outside of my house it feels uncomfortable. If its been 24+ hours, is there any reason I cant get in the car, maskless, and drive around? I wash my hands enough that I can handle doing that. With health anxiety, I worry about walking the line between conscientious and crazy. Im not sure where this one sits.",

Id feel better if I was further along as were peaking, but, lol nope. More than half my coworkers are out sick and management doesnt want us talking about it because it makes customers uncomfortable. COVID has caused me so much anxiety and grief these past two years. I lost my career and a good chunk of my sanity. If I lose this too, I dont know how Ill be able to go on.

There's talk abt reduced symptom *severity*, and some vague studies on antibody levels, but rn the messaging is very much \"you'll still catch it, you'll still get sick, but at least it won't be *as* bad.\" and sometimes even the I know that a lot of this is too new to have super solid information on but it seems almost eerie that I'm not finding *anything*. A lot of \"well, we *think* it *should* work,\" which...doesn't feel encouraging. I'll be honest, I'm just as if not more worried about *any* symptomatic infection, mild or not than I am about the risk of getting severe symptoms (basically, even just getting sick *at all* poses a list of logistical nightmares in my current situation). Add that to having terrible side effects after my second dose, a very strong phobia of nausea (which I got) and a moderate phobia of fevers/chills (which I *definitely* got, oh, god) and the worry about having to either take extra time off work from it depending on how long symptoms last...I'm genuinely considering cancelling my appt tomorrow. Most likely scenario I see rn is I get boosted, deal with *that* again, and then still end up catching covid, having to quarrantine, etc and my only consolation is that I don't get *as* sick. I know the official line is \"always get boosted!!!\" but I need some help convincing myself because the thought of going through what I went through on the second shot again is more than I can handle rn.",

I have the usual symptoms such as headache and loss of taste and smell, but Ive also been experiencing some not so common symptoms as well and would like some feedback to see if there are others who have experienced it as well. These past few days when I started losing my sense of smell, I noticed a tingling sensation that started in my nose and extended throughout my face little by little. I believe Im on day 6 today, and today I noticed that the tingling sensation has evolved into a sharper pain. I feel it all around my jaw and on my chin, its to the point where my jaw feels like it stiffens up or it locks up all of a sudden. Has anyone else experienced this? I was thinking this may be related to the fact that I had a chin lipo a year ago. The sharp pain on my chin centers right where the cannula was inserted and I figured this might have to do with some sort of microvascular issue in relation to COVID, since I just started experiencing this a few days ago.",

On Monday I was feeling completely fine, but then on Tuesday I woke up with a scratchy throat, nasal congestion, fatigue, but I figured since my body doesnt do well with weather changes, I figured I was having a reaction from the cool dry air. Then yesterday I started to feel even worse, having the chills and nausea on top of the other symptoms, and now Ive just thrown up. It could be possible because my mom is a preschool teacher and one of the classrooms next to her shut down because like half the kids and the teachers were positive, so the rest of the kids from that classroom are now in her room. She told me on Monday evening. Covid tests are very difficult to go do in my area right now because of the surge. Although I would like to test, it has been extremely difficult to do so. Would it be safe to assume I likely have covid since a lot of my symptoms line up with omicron? It hasnt been particularly unbearable (Ive been double vaxxed and boosted since November).",

I was concerned about infection from my trip, even with me taking the best of precautions. You guys, as always, were more than supportive! Well, I'm sad to report, that my friend did end up testing positive. We are ending our trip early to head home. We were sharing a hotel room and will be sharing a car (we have no choice) and taking measures to keep me safe. At this time I have tested negative, however I know that can change because only 4 days has passed. I'm not sure how I feel at this point. Weirdly calm but I have my moments where I feel a full blown panic set in. I'm going to isolate immediately when I get home and get tested 4 days after my arrival. I guess I am scared, I don't want my parents to catch it from me. Nor do I want to catch it myself. But do feel immense guilt going on this trip in the first place.",

My workplace has undergone a huge transformation, which means that the default model is working from home. You can work in the office for mental health reasons (such as if you live alone). I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room. In 2019, I met a guy, sparks flew between us, and we were going to meet up. He lives in a different country. It has just fizzled out. My self esteem has plummeted as my weight has rocketed. Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office. Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit. Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement. And I'm symptomatic, which has led to me losing my voice so I can't even speak to anyone on the phone. Which is not good as I've been on and off crying since I got back. And my throat is so sore, hurts to cough, hurts to swallow. I'm just at the point where I'm really not coping. TL;DR My life was looking good, then the pandemic transformed my workplace to mostly WFH, home is 1 bed flat, I live alone. Mental health plummeted, now I have covid.",

We did not have any contact with my brother or SIL during these two weeks. Friday (New Year's Eve): My brother and his wife went out for New Year's Eve, and this is likely where they got covid (although they are not careful at all so it could have been before or after this, who knows) Sunday: My parents briefly met up with my brother in a parking lot to give him his kids back. My mom was masked and seated inside the car while my brother (NOT masked) had his head inside while he got the kids' car seats out. But she says there were 2-3 car doors open while this happened (i.e ventilation). My dad was masked and standing outside the whole time. The whole exchange was about 5-10 minutes and it was a windy day. Then my parents drove 3 hours back home, unmasked in the car. Monday: My brother's wife developed symptoms, she later tested positive Thursday: My brother developed symptoms (unsure if he had them earlier or if this was the first day) So my parents are isolating in their room just in case they have it and will get tested tomorrow on day 5. Although I think I would have already got it from them by now. I think the odds are really really slim. What do you think? Should we get tested? Isolate?

I don't really like the Canadian governments' handling, and look at Taiwan as the best model for covid (also with a smarter culture) and just wish we could do what Taiwan is doing - they're all walking around freely! In Canada we've been in yo-yo lockdowns for so long, and hospitals are filling up disproportionately with the unvaccinated^(). And I just think to myself, if all you MF would just get vaccinated, perhaps - maybe - we could avoid a lockdown or at least have a shorter one. I used to rant about the government's handling in some skeptical subreddits, but it's full of stupid people claiming that vaccines are deadly and that lockdowns are some global conspiracy to strip us of our rights. *Trust me, our politicians do not care about us enough to hatch a plan like that. There's no money in locking us all down!* It just frustrates me that there seems to be only two extreme sides: Those who think everyone is out to get them, and those who are to get everyone. Come on people, follow the science. Get vaccinated! Demand better testing, tracing and tacking! Call for local lockdowns to happen sooner to stop covid spread in its infancy. Insist on quarantines for travellers and the positive to be mandatory (and cheap/free). At this rate I'm gonna learn Mandarin and move to Taiwan &lt;\\_&lt; ^() [^([url]",

I on the other hand take this seriously, has been double vaccinated with <ORG>, and wears a mask everyday within the house to avoid getting infected. For the past 3 days I've been having a sore throat, runny nose, coughs, and a few headaches here and there. I've also have been feeling very tired. Luckily my symptoms seems to get better rather than worse over time? It's weird. I'm assuming I got infected but my rapid test came in as negative. I'm waiting for my PCR results but it'll take a few days for it to come in, I took the tests on 1/4/22. I have a flight to Canada (from the US) on the 18th, I really hope things go as planned. I had my flight canceled multiple times and it would be really upsetting if this were to get canceled as well. I've also been reading a lot of posts about peoples rapid test coming out negative but the PCR coming out positive? Is the chances of me falling within this category high? Lets say I do get marked as positive, will I have enough time to recover and become negative before the 18th? Any advice on healing quickly? I've been drinking a lot of water, took Tylenol, vitamins, 9MG Melatonin and sleeping early for the past few days now. How long did you remain positive for? If I were to be marked as negative what advice would you give for me to not get infected till the 18th? Will be a very stressful 12 days haha. 20 Y/O Male btw",

I developed a sore throat and nothing else on the 25th or possibly the 27th (symptom was very mild, so I'm not sure exactly when), which was gone by January 2nd (to be replaced by sniffles and a mild cough). No fever, loss of smell, chills, fatigue, or anything like that. I was double-vaccinated at the time, am now boosted because appointments were hard to snag. Testing appointments are also hard to get, even for rapid tests, and I got one yesterday (January 5th) at a pharmacy. The pharmacist only swabbed my nose. The test came back negative, but I still have the cough (though again, no other symptoms). I can't get another test until Monday at the earliest, because there are no available appointments. I work primarily from home (second, public-facing job was shut down under the new restrictions) and don't have any family in the city (so didn't attend any holiday parties - it was just me and my partner, who also works from home and didn't attend any parties), but I still have to get groceries. Delivery is expensive enough that if I can avoid it, I would prefer to. Can I trust this test? (If you're getting confused with the math (I was), symptoms developed either on the 25th (12 days before the test) or on the 27th (10 days). I've heard way too many stories of false negatives.",

We didn't wear masks (ugh after usually being so careful, I guess you can't be careful enough!) The infected person held our baby for about 5 mins and wasn't really physically close to my other child except for a brief hug. We are all vaccinated and boosted except the children.

In 2019, I failed a university course (vector &amp; complex calculus if anyone is asking) in November. I was offered to do the supplementary examination in December, which I tried but also failed. I am just depressed because I ruined the last summer before the pandemic struck. My summer was ruined at first trying in vain to study for the supplementary examination, and then in a depressed rut after seeing that I failed the supplementary examination. If I had just pushed myself a bit harder in vector calculus, I could've had one last carefree summer before all the shenanigans of 2020 happened. It is something I regret. If I can change one thing about pre-COVID 2019, I would have made myself try harder in vector calculus.",

Im going to ask the place if they can PCR test me as well but idk what they will say- my question is basically, if i test negative on antigen tomorrow do you think its highly unlikely that I/we have covid?? im very stressed because i know theyre less accurate. I just hate how inaccessible testing is right now. its either pay money for an antigen test or wait 5 hours in line.. Btw we are both fully vaccinated and got the booster.",

And we had a million cases in 1 day in the USA which I never thought would even be possible. I also spoke to my therapist about it, and she told me that people in the trans community are very covid cautious. And that the reason why a lot of people in that community didn't try returning to normal over the summer was because of a lack of social support from their families. She basically told me that for now I should try a different zoom group to find new friends. And I've tried zoom groups and had pretty bad luck with them in general, and one of the zoom groups I went to criticized me when I said I was thinking of going to Florida for spring break last year, and even after I got vaccinated. And then there's the issue of mask mandates, I have a very hard time seeing how my area will get cases low enough to remove the mask mandate now since they're goal for removing the mandate is currently focused on cases and not hospitalizations. I have a very hard time seeing how omnicron will change their metrics to having lower hospitalizations.",

We were in shared custody before, and last summer his mother basically lost her ever living #$% and is just barely getting into relative stability now. We went through the courts and my brilliant, affectionate, funny, wonderful 13 year old son now lives with me, with only a few days every few weeks at his mom's, which he's actually not quite happy about. As part of the agreement, he spent a few days with her over New Years. He left the 30th and was supposed to come back the 4th. During the night 31st--&gt;1st, he calls me at 2am, panicking: his mom tested positive with a home test for COVID, and he tested negative. The earliest I could pick him back up was the 2nd, and he isolated as much as possible between then and when I could pick him up. Upon returning to my place we were meticulously cautious. He's confined in his room, even for his meals, - he doesn't step outside except to use the washroom which I clean after every use. I try to keep it light, stay - both masked - more than 2m from each other to discuss his homework and read stuff to each other. The days are passing and he remains 100% symptoms free. I'm assuming he was exposed right when he went over there, on the 30th, which would make it day \"1\", and would make today day \"9\", although I'm assuming that the most cautious scenario would be to consider the last contact with her (Jan 2nd) as day \"1\", which would only make today day \"6\". Here's the thing though: it's start to weigh on both him and me, and the idea that we couldn't even have the week-end to do anything together is making him be quite down. Whether we consider today day 6 or day 9, he's still rigorously symptoms-free. Can you help me think through the risks here? I don't want to end his quarantine before it's logical to do so, but I can see the effect it's having... Looking fw to your thoughts",

To some, it means covid-19 is eradicated from the face of the earth, which doesn't actually have to happen for life to return to normal. From what people are saying on this sub, they feel run down by the concept of \"pandemic\" as much as any actual restrictions. In October of 2020, I cancelled my travel home to see my family for the holidays. For months, I'd had in person indoor contact with exactly three other humans. Now, * I get to see many all-vax friends regularly * I feel safe at all-vax restaurants, movie theaters, and large parties * I've got that dope booster immunity * My family and the CDC all approved me going home twice, once for Thanksgiving and once for Christmas. * Case counts may be high, but hospitals are not at capacity due to vaccines, improved treatments, and the actual virus getting milder I'm looking forward to not feeling stressed in non-vax-controlled environments when someone coughs or doesn't mask properly. This is more about me than the pandemic, so I don't know when it will change. I recognize that many of the freedoms available in my highly vaccinated area are less available elsewhere. There's a ways to go, but I think it's really important to keep the pandemic in terms of concrete things that matter. A lot has changed in these two years.

Its a small retail store with two departments and we are required to wear mask. We share common areas such as a break room and bathrooms. Over the past month theres been a few times Ive wondered if I was positive but always come back negative on a rapid + 1 PCR. Yesterday I experienced a bad headache that went away with Advil and a slight runny nose. This morning I woke up with a bad headache that eventually mostly went awaybut terrible diarrhea. Its still the afternoon and Ive gone 7-8 times. My stomach feels fine, no fever, and negative on a rapid. Its just such a struggle to know if Im actually positive or if my mind is just making me feel this way. The strange thing is, and please dont judge me for this, Im not afraid of getting COVID.

This is the fourth time in my household that someone has covid, first me late 2020, then my father in early 2021, after that one of my brothers and my mom in late 2021 and now my youngest brother. When I got the news I just couldn't take it anymore. It seems like this isn't going to end soon, and I just had a wave of emotions that I didn't know how to manage: I was scared for my brother, I was angry, I was ashamed that this happened AGAIN in my home. I wanted to scream and cry and to be done with everything, all at the same time. I had to tell my workplace and my boyfriend that somebody got sick again, I just kept thinking how we need to adjust all at home to take care of my brother and I felt extremely guilty for going out to work or seeing my boyfriend when my brother still didn't show signs of COVID. I just went up to my room and cried a little bit trying to control my anxiety, and then I just went on with all the things we needed to do to take care of my brother. I had anxiety long before COVID, so sometimes there are days I really struggle with. There are some days when I just don't think I'm able to continue anymore and I just wish that everything was over, but there doesn't seem like there is an end to this cycle.",

My covid anxiety was finally gone in 2021 (I'm in Canada, we got our numbers so low) and now it's back full force to the point that I have a panic attack every day. My parents are anti-vax and are friends with even more severe militant anti-vaxers who are also conspiracy theorists. I am an adult who lives alone apart from them. My mom has had two vaccines and my dad is unvaccinated. I've had nightmares and anxiety attacks about my dad dying from covid since the beginning of the pandemic. He refuses to get vaccinated no matter what I say, how I beg or how I plead. On new years, my parents partied with their antivax friends. Last night I had yet another nightmare in light of omicron. Today my dad tested positive. I have not been able to calm down. I've been crying, panicking, the whole nine yards. Nothing I Google regarding an unvaccinated person's chances against the virus is comforting. I'm terrified my dad is going to die. I'm not ready to lose my dad. I just lost my uncle to cancer a month ago. My dad is 60 years old and he's very healthy and fit for his age, but I'm still worried because of his age. Currently he has no symptoms and my mom keeps telling me I'm being alarmist and ridiculous for freaking out so much but I keep panicking about my dad suddenly dying in his sleep or it suddenly turning worse really fast. Additionally, my parents were likely exposed on Dec 30-31 and on Jan 2 my mom insisted on dropping off a bag of food at my place. She's fully vaxxed and I had her stand outside (open doorway) to hand me off the bag, she wore a mask and I wore two masks (I'm triple vaxxed) and yet I'm still absolutely petrified ill develop symptoms at any moment. Literally any words of comfort or something could help rn, all my friends say is \"I'm sorry\" like my dad is already dead and I freak out even more.",

Even I've been trying to get in contact with a girl who went to school with me, graduated in 2020 during Covid. For two years I've wanted to see her. We eventually texted a bit, but then her lack of communication and respect of autism caused issues. She visited the school again, and I was going to see her, but again lack of communication. We talked later that night and she said \"I said hi to the teachers, I roamed\" and I got very frustrated. And since then, I wanted to meet that girl. I just wrote letters and shit, and it's not doing a thing. It's making me think that I should've met her in the past, where she would've been more nice rather than have her watch me kill myself in a global pandemic. I just wish we talked properly. That's all. She thinks there's no COVID in her eyes. Oh speaking of that, a dysfunctional family and other environments. On some days everything would be good, some days would be shit.

Nothing severe so far, just congestion and a cough, for the most part. I have asked them about other symptoms and other than some difficulty smelling due to the fact that their nose is stuffed up, there's nothing else to report. They're recently boosted. I'm almost five months out from my second dose, so it's nearly my turn to get boosted too. I have congestion here and there, but mostly I'm just aching and exhausted, and I kept getting headaches on and off, though they seem to have stopped for now. I work from home, but it's been almost impossible to get anything done in the past few days because I'm just so tired all the time. I know we can write this off as something non-COVID, but I'm trying to be realistic here and someone at my family member's job is out with a confirmed case. They were definitely exposed, at the very least. Getting tested is next to impossible, though I'm looking. When I heard the news about how contagious omicron is, I kind of just... accepted the reality that getting it was a definite possibility, even as a vaccinated person. But now that it's looking really likely, especially when I'm reading that experts are saying to assume COVID before you assume the flu or a cold... I'm pretty scared. I tried to get boosted, but until a few days ago, it was too early. I'm trying to stay away from places like the subreddit where people discuss their confirmed cases exclusively. It's a great resource but at this point it's just going to scare the shit out of me, as it's more likely to attract people with more notable (aka, more symptomatic) cases.",

Yesterday, partner conceded that the risks from the vaccine seem pretty low and I could bring 5yo to get vaccinated. We are both on the same page with being stressed about any long term implications of the vaccine. My position was that the long term implications and side effects of Covid seemed more serious and significant. I took 5yo to get their first dose yesterday and while Im hopeful this is the right thing, it is still making me anxious that I fought for this and something will go wrong. Get to do this all over again with our 2 year old whenever that vaccine is approved. Has anyone else been navigating these waters with mixed feelings, or dealing with a co-parent that is on the opposite side of the fence?",

The last months already looked like shit was hitting the fan, but now it's worse. I got in contact with a positive pal, and now need to quarantine (again!), right before finals (and I still have no idea how my college is gonna handle them!). I have some troubling health issues (on top of the smaller but covid-like I had before) that I really need to get checked for, but between the Omicron surge (that has brought the local system almost to collapse), a hacker attack against the health infrastructure, trouble with college and *this* I can't get a professional (or even a doctor) in a timely manner. A relative is ill, but because of the mess testing and diagnosis have been getting increasingly delayed, and I fear that, when it'll be possible again, it's gonna be to late. Also, testing (at least the good kind) is basically unavailable here. Because of many things (again, mostly covid) I also lack a social net, so no partner and only very superficial friendships and all far away. Cherry on the top, studying has been very hard lately, and I may not be able to pass my exams. And I'm not listing everything, only what I'm comfortable with Reddit knowing. So yeah. Fuck. For any of you who had big struggles, how did you manage to stay sane? To maintain some semblance of functionality? Or, at least, can someone please tell me it's gonna be manageable (I don't even believe in OK anymore, only in \"not worst)?",

Again, I will state that I brought this up with my employer at the time and they accepted the 1 test, rather than both. I tried to be as open and honest as I could.

Its okay in the summer because I can go for outdoor walks and such, but now that its winter, I feel like I mostly sit inside and stew on the latest media.

Near the end of my shift was feeling fatigued was coughing ((had my mask on plus I take Marijuana medicinally so I didn't think anything of it)) That night had a horrid fever the next morning couldn't even get up. Still had my taste at this point but it started to wane...the next day boom no taste/smell. It sucks and has really depressed me. I love cooking I love my job but losing my sense of smell/taste is like a painter gone blind...a composer gone deaf.. It's been horrible. Thst and I've been reading some people it can take a year! Maybe I shouldn't have read those reports but I don't know how to deal with this. Can't get tested ((I live in FL tests have been extremely limited and my car isn't running so I've been relying on uber/lyft. I just...man I don't know...this is taxing on the mind and soul..",

So, if you've read my previous posts, you'll know my situation of living with antivax parents and how that has affected me mentally speaking. Well, to cut a long story short, I did what you recommended me: I got my shot in secret. Yesterday I got my first dose of Sputnik, and in February I'll try to get the second one. No side effects, apart from pain in the place of the injection. It's been more than 24 hours, so I guess I'm good on that side. It honestly feels surreal. I didn't even plan for it to happen that way, it was a spur of the moment decision. But now something troubles me. I fear my family may get to know it, and I don't feel the same having to hide it from them. I fear I was being impulsive and the best choice was to wait. I try to tell myself I had little choice, with Delta increasing the cases in my town, but it doesn't feel that way. There's also the fears theorists have put on my head, like infertility or altered DNA. Did I do it right? Or I should've just wait? I know it sounds silly, but I'm really second guessing myself. I was actually going to poost here for advice before going to the hospital, but as I said, it was pretty much a spontaneus decision. Thank you for reading, and to anyone who comments. Have a good day.",

There are so many questions I realized I couldn't answer with certainty when discussing Covid with them. I was hoping to get some help for answers here. 1. If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? For example, if I am vaccinated and my cousin is not, we both meet my uncle who has Covid and are exposed. Since I am vaccinated, is there a higher chance that my body rejects the virus and so I don't become a carrier and spread it to others? If so, how much higher are the odds (if all other things are equal)? 2. If you had Covid previously, do you have a lesser chance of spreading it? Do Covid survivors have some immunity, so when they are exposed to someone with Covid, they have a much lesser chance to becoming a carrier. Since I had Covid AND I am vaccinated, am I much less likely to be a carrier now? Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but these questions are about the general odds. It seems like the narrative is constantly changing so it gets confusing. For example, now the news seems to be saying that even if your vaccinated you're going to get Covid, but you'll have milder symptoms. Or that you can spread it almost as easily as someone who is not vaccinated, etc. It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this. All news that I've been hearing are very vague with this type of stuff and I don't know why.",

I live in LA County and we hit 43,000 cases in a day the other day so I've been extra cautious. Yesterday my mom (~60, not boosted but vaccinated) went to eat at a restaurant inside a crowded mall for approx 2/3 hours with her friends. I won't control what she does, but I'm not sure how to proceed risk-wise. I'm not afraid of having any serious illness given my age and my mom is at least vaccinated so I feel fine about that, but the one thing I refuse to roll the dice on is having my smell/taste impacted. I have several friends who have diminished or altered smell/taste after having COVID and I would be absolutely devastated if that happened to me. I'd feel bad if I had to distance from my mom just because she went out. Normally I'd think the risk is probably pretty low, but with numbers this high I'm not sure what to think. Any advice? Or anything to assuage my fears about smell/taste? I'm not sure if vaccinations possibly help in that regard.",

On the 2nd-4th days I was getting really sharp pains in my chest, mostly heart region. This occurred when I was taking deep breaths, which felt necessary at the time. At this point they have mostly stopped but my chest is still feeling tight and the sharp pains happen occasionally. I have also had a lump in my throat that remains persistent. I have no other symptoms, only these two. The chest pains have lessened, but the throat tightness/lump has remained consistent. Im quite worried as I had asthma as a child &amp; I also have IBS. Thank you in advance! Id love to hear other peoples perspectives - - Sorry if this sounds a bit off, I have Autism so explanations can be difficult.

I am 27 and a university student and school starts back up in-person in a couple weeks. My school has announced there will be no delay to the start of in-person classes and I have a job on campus as well that starts at that time. I'll be honest, I'm terrified of catching and dying of COVID. I don't see how there will be a full return to in-person classes without a huge surge on campus, and I don't know how I am going to avoid getting it, from classes or my job. My vaccination status reassures me somewhat, but I also have a few health problems that have clearly shown to carry a high risk when it comes to COVID. Firstly my BMI is very high at 49. I have lost over 60 pounds in the last few months and am going strong with weight loss and healthier eating/daily exercise. But my weight being so high is still clearly putting me at higher risk. Additionally I have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease that is an additional risk factor, especially combined with obesity. I have been attempting to get healthier to address both of these concerns but I am scared that this will not be enough and catching COVID could kill me. I have had an overwhelming feeling of impending doom. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this anxiety/ have any perspective on this situation? I am trying to find a way to only take online classes but I don't know how I'll get by without my job. Any reassurance or insight would be appreciated.",

We did a couple of crowded indoor public things around xmas and tested negative. And we are back to commuting to/from school tomorrow.

        "Reddit Post": "Hopefully this is the right sub for this. Just looking for some advice after receiving a positive Covid test. So, a little background. I started feeling sick this last Tuesday (1/4) at work. Have a chronic cough that got worse and started having bad headaches, muscle aches, congestion, etc. Went home early and got tested Wednesday (1/5). Test came back positive. Doctor told me to come home and self-isolate for at least 10 days since I started feeling sick, so that would be 1/14, since that's when I knew for sure I was feeling sick. I got a doctor's note for work to explain this. Got a call Friday from my boss saying that, due to the new CDC guidelines, the state institution I work for is only requiring five days of quarantine, no need to retest, and that I should be cleared for work this coming Monday (1/10), provided I have improving symptoms. As of right now, other than the occasional cough and some congestion, I'm feeling a lot better, and even those are WAY better than where I was at on Tuesday. Obviously, I want to get back to work, but I'm concerned about how short the quarantine my work is requiring is, when even the doctor was saying I should quarantine for at least 10 days. I, luckily, didn't infect anyone at work, and I'm concerned that I might do so if I return early. Because of the nature of the job, there's a high likelihood that, if I'm still contagious, they'll also get it. Any advice? Should I talk to my boss on Monday, explain the situation, and try to use vacation to cover it? Or should I follow the CDC and my work's guidelines? Really not sure how to proceed here.",

Vaccines werent available in the Philippines for a very long time, and when they finally arrived it was an absolute shit show (endless hours spent on the hotline trying to get an appointment and so on). When I got an appointment after a few months, I couldnt really choose what vaccine I wanted to get, and was presented with Sinovac only. I was hesitant at first, because I heard it might be discredited in the US among other countries, but when I checked the requirements for EU, it stated that Sinovac was authorized by WHO and so I just went with it. I also couldnt really afford to be choosy since I had waited for so long and just wanted to be vaccinated already. Fast forward a few weeks later after receiving my second shot, Sinovac is not authorized for people that want to enter the EU anymore, meaning even if I do get a <ORG> / <ORG> booster shot now, it still wont count. Another option for entering would be to show a proof of recovery, which I dont have and dont know if Ill be able to produce since I havent contracted Covid yet (at least to my knowledge, never had any symptoms). What should I do next? Thank you all in advance for your help!",

We have booked a tour for 2 wedding venues and so we decided to make a little staycation out of it. We also have a massage booked, but even if we did go to the staycation we would cancel the massage as thats too high risk for me. Indoor dining is closed due to restrictions, so we will just order room service. So the only high-risk activities we would be doing would be interacting with the hotel reception desk and interacting with the 2 people that will give us the tours of the venues.

We also wear 3 masks at once (I know Im a bit insane lol), including a KN95, a good quality cloth mask, and a surgical mask on top.

I'm a young fit male early 20's trying to rationalize that those won't happen to me but it is always a chance, more so with COVID. I'd hate to get the vaccine and have severe complications or worse but I also don't want to take a chance with COVID itself.

Mostly all of my friends around me have the vaccine and its reassuring but I'd hate to be the one that experiences something severe.

In my class 3 students tested positive last week ( around the middle and end of the week) so basically they had the entire week to spread the disease. One of them had symptoms since Wednesday and showed up anyway. It's just a matter of time before someone else is positive. There are also many cases amongst 2nd and 3rd year students, last week a few students who were close contacts showed up to class anyway (without getting tested). Today all 3rd year students were sent home, they are considered a cluster. I wasn't there thankfully but that's what my classmates told me. I don't want to go there catch covid and take the subway / bus and the end of the day and spread it even more. They refuse to let us work from home, even though we only need our laptops to work. Subways are packed like crazy of course. It's driving me crazy, it feels like they are just waiting for the whole school to turn into a cluster to close it. I feel bad for not wanting to go, I don't want to get in trouble, but at the same time I also think the school should take proper action before it's too late maybe not close the whole place but my class is pretty high risk right now so we shouldn't have to go anymore at this point. I might stay at home tomorrow anyway, I'll have to lie, but this is nonsense anyway. Just felt the need to get this off my chest.",

However, I woke up today feeling a little worse - cough has gotten worse and I have slight congestion today - feels like the very beginning or the very end of a cold. I'm wondering for other people who are tripled or double vaxxed who ended up getting COVID-19, what was your course of illness like? Just curious how it's been for others, and wondering if I will continue to get worse. It's interesting to me that I \"plateaued\" for 4 days before progressing again. Luckily, I still feel pretty good and I have my vaccines to thank for that! I don't know if I have Omicron or not but it's likely that I do as it has pretty much displaced delta where I live.",

It's followed with more doom and gloom theories like the idea that \"masks don't work\" and \"vaccines don't work\", etc. There has been this idea that some Covid was a magical, mysterious new force that could evade all attempts to stop it. But it's not. It's dangerous, sure, but it is just a virus. It isn't \"trying to find a way around our immunity\" or \"going after certain populations\". It isn't waiting for prayers to stop it. It's stupid. It's not even a life-form. It's a piece of biological machinery dependent entirely on the living to do anything at all. It's a gear...not the engine. Masks slow it down, quarantine slow it down more, vaccines much more than that and so on. But to really go back to pre-covid19 days we would need not only vaccines, herd immunity and basic safety measures, but also a way to \"Tamiflu\" the virus if caught in the early days. All these steps together should bring us back to levels and severity more consistent with a typical flu season. And if instead of regular covid shots along with our flu shots we could get a LIFETIME immunity, well that would just be a ridiculously good outcome. Omicron is typically a milder version on an individual basis than other variants and while it is spreading too quickly to be safe to society at large, it will create a lot of herd immunity. With these two final pieces of news, hope is definitely on the horizon. &amp;#x200B; [[url] &amp;#x200B; [[url]",

Because honestly, there is no guarantee that we wont be getting another deadly variant that may be even as transmissible as the current one. And this pandemic has thrown so many curveballs that it feels like it wont end any time soon. Maybe in 10 years. Every time we are told oh it will end very soon, it doesnt. I think my hope has run dry. Theres nothing concrete to hold onto and hope just feels illogical. If were just going to be in a perpetual pandemic because we refused to give vaccines to the poor countries of the world, Im not sure how much longer I can live with this. Ill stay alive for now, but once it reaches fall 2024, when Ill have completed an associates degree and will be moving on to university, I have a vague plan to possibly end my life if its still like this at that point.

I don't use the microwave and when I take food out of the fridge, I leave it for 30 minutes so at room temperature before eating it. The microwave kills all the nutrients in food. I rarely eat any type of junk food hence why I never get sick! I make sure I get enough sleep every night and well as work out every day and meditate. I have never met one person that lives a healthy life like myself hence why I never get sick. Before 10 years it was a different story cause I had such a poor lifestyle. I've lost my job cause I didn't get the Covid vaccine. Can't do lots of things now cause I've lost my rights BUT if you have Covid, you are excepted for 6 months. You can do what the vaccinated can do (everything) where I can go back to work if I get Covid and travel. 2 of my housemates have Covid where I want to get Covid from them. It's been 2 days where they have been vaccinated but my girlfriend and I have no symptoms still. I shook their hands, let them cough where they shake my hand and I rub it in my face. It's been 2 days and I don't have any symptoms. I want to make sure I get Covid tomorrow where I'm going to get tested in 2 days. How can I make sure I get Covid tomorrow? I want my old life back and the same rights as being vaccinated. If catching Covid is the only way, so be it! I have to put food on the table at the end of the day.",

I have not had a cough or a runny nose. I still have my sense of taste and smell. The worst lingering symptoms are headache and fatigue.

She has already fallen twice from dehydration. I have nothing to do with their family - half are Catholic zealots and the other half are Bible Baptist, anti-vaxxing, end of times zealots and when I say half I mean half of like a literal 100 kids/grand kids/great grandkids (it's a big breeding family for sure). Here's my dilemma I could use some thoughts on.... My mom and I just got our relationship on a healthy track the last few years, I am almost 40 and I am not trying to spend another 40 years fixing it again. However, I am not about to go to a funeral with a family of that size that is comprised of so many unvaccinated people, the kind that proudly post pictures of them wearing lace masks on airplanes.... Yeah, they are those people.... But I want to obviously be there for my mother. Slight kink in the works - my mom has bipolar and is in a deep depressive state at the moment. How do I kindly refuse to go to a funeral where I have no doubt there will be covid flying around without my mom feelings like I am abandoning her?",

They have been going out to bars and outings since they've recovered and we can't run the risk of that test being the \"old\" covid or a new infection.

I tested positive for covid about three and a half weeks ago and my girlfriend had very similar symptoms so we assumed she had it too, but she only got tested once early on and it was negative. The last few days shes been developing some kind of sickness, and was up all night throwing up. We assumed it was a flu, but I gave her a rapid because we had one around. Seeing a positive today, Im wondering if she didnt have it then but does now, or if its just still in her system. (We are both vaxxed but no booster yet) Thanks!",

Managing my health anxiety has been a struggle, but I managed. It helped that I'm in a position where I can pretty much isolate myself if needed. I often resorted to that in times of high transmission rates. It always felt like there was at least some chance of avoiding Covid. But now? Like this quote from a [BBC article]([url] \"Today the Omicron variant represents a new west-to-east tidal wave, sweeping across the region on top of the Delta surge that all countries were managing until late 2021,\" Dr Kluge told a news conference. He quoted the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as forecasting that \"more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks\". Stuff like that just leaves me at a complete loss on what to do now. I'm incredibly afraid of getting Covid, mainly because I have rotten luck when it comes to health stuff. I'm convinced that it will make me very unwell. The common vibe in my country and pretty much everywhere is: \"Eh, everyone will get it, so \" And I just don't know where this leaves people who are at risk. I'm trying not to obsess over it and try to distract myself as much as possible. But really, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop and it sucks so much. I live in a country where the government has pretty much given up and everyone just wants to get this over with. But at what cost? Even if I might be fine, I have immunocompromised loved ones and I don't know if they'll survive this. I'm beyond frustrated and sad and this whole 'let's end the pandemic with a BANG' mood I'm seeing everywhere feels dreadful.",

A few people in the group are unvaccinated, and for this reason we felt that it would be fair for everyone test before getting together. Decision was made in December, a reminder was sent out yesterday to make sure everyone was on the same page. For a few reasons we are trying to be extra cautious.. 1. 3 kids under 3 will be attending 2. 1 5 month pregnant guest 3. 2 guests actively trying to get pregnant One couple pushed back pretty hard following the reminder. They voiced up it being unfair to expect them test and that it is their right to not share medical information (only thing we asked about was result of COVID test, nothing to do with vaccination). Also, since they live in a more rural town they cited not being able to get tested due to the time it take and availability(I looked into the Walgreens in their town, tons of availability to get a free, drive-up test within a couple miles from their home. This is not something I brought up to them). They also suggested the my wife and myself choose not to attend the event since I am the one who initially shared the request to test (I typically coordinate events). Not everyone in the group is concerned about COVID, but up until now everyone was willing to accommodate the most cautious if it means being able to get together. Between the young kids, pregnant woman, couples trying to get pregnant and some friends who are anxious/nervous about COVID it just made sense to me to ask this of this group. Other than the one couple who voiced against getting tested, nobody has complained even though I am sure a few other people aren't thrilled. I'd love some feedback on the situation.",

I soon followed suit, and contracted it myself a couple days after as well. We've both been out of work for 9 days now, both of us still testing positive. My place of work has been hit hard with COVID since I left, so they recommended a place to get a rapid test and hinted that I would be reimbursed for the test if I saved my receipt. Up to this point, my Regional Manager has been very helpful and kind about this situation. This test was $125, which was the most expensive one so far. I knew my work had told me to keep the receipt, so I assumed it would be matched by my work. I tested positive still, so I sent her a picture of the paperwork and she says, \"Cool, we'll reimburse you.\" Seconds later, she texts, \"oops, you actually don't get reimbursed. You got it from your girlfriend and not someone at work. So since you were the first person to bring it in, everyone else gets a free testing since YOU gave it to them.\" How could they blame me, with no concrete proof? How could they think to give everyone else a reimbursement but me? It's almost as if they're punishing me for thinking I was the cause of this! There's no way to prove I brought this infection, in a retail job where we handle up to 100 customers a day? And even if that was the case, they are supposed to cover the costs of COVID testing for ALL employees regardless, right? I'm feeling very frustrated and angry, and I just need answers. Is there someone I can call to sort this out? Or should I just accept my losses?",

I live with a family member that I would prefer not to expose to the virus. I've been quarantined for the last week and I've tested at home, and was negative 5 days (around what was the mean day of symptom onset) after exposure. I've had COVID before, and I got sick around 5 days after COVID exposure the last time. I'm triple vaccinated now, too. I still feel like I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop. Every twinge in my back, sneeze, and throat tickle puts me on edge (I'm in New England so the air is insanely dry right now, both outside due to the bitter cold and inside due to heating). I know I'm not out of the possible incubation period, but I just feel like I can't be so lucky as to have direct exposure and not get sick this time. Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the vaccine, but it feels like with so many breakthrough cases that I should just expect to get reinfected. I've read booster efficacy sits around 75%. I feel like that should be more reassuring than what my current state of mind has me feeling. I used to feel a sense of comfort, having been vaccinated and having \"hybrid\" immunity, etc, but this surge of Omicron has really crushed that feeling. I know it's milder, which I'm happy about. It's just that this moment we're living through is incredibly unnerving. I'm essentially just venting and trying not to catastrophize. Thanks for reading.",

Like, really adventurous, even as a kid. I relished the opportunity to venture outside my comfort zone and try new foods, including new applications of the few ingredients I didnt like. I even loved pungent foods - washed rind cheese, jars of anchovies, fermented soybeans, you name it. Fast forward almost two years since the pandemic and I hardly recognise this version of myself anymore. I tend to gravitate towards the same four vegetables over and over again, unless other vegetables have been pureed or cooked beyond recognition. Most textures repulse me to the extent where I will cycle through the same meals which usually tend to be on the blander side. I grew up in a multicultural household so for me to be eating food so lacking in flavour (curries are now well and truly out of the question) oddly feels like Im losing part of myself, which is consistent with how many of us are feeling at the moment. Ive been through a lot of major changes over the past 24 months, pandemic notwithstanding, and as someone with depression and anxiety, this may well relate to that. That said, I was wondering if anyone else has observed significant changes to their eating habits, and whether this has coincided with any major changes in circumstances and wellbeing.

        "Reddit Post": "I've already delayed treatment for my chronic illness due to my parents being furloughed early on in the pandemic and therefore losing healthcare. I was told (before losing healthcare) delaying may result in needing a liver transplant, but don't know how likely this actually is. I was able to start treatment a couple months ago (a year later than planned) and now they want me to come in and do tests to see how it's working, like ideally in the next week. However, I live outside the service zone of my parents' insurance, and I would be traveling to the Bay from LA when currently omicron is spiking here. Both my partner and I work in schools where a shitton of students and faculty have tested positive or been exposed, specificallytoday. My father has stage 3, almost stage 4 cancer and has been doing weekly radiation and my mother works in-person, so I don't want to expose the household further. Paying to stay anywhere else isn't financially feasible (actually, even traveling up there by bus or plane will almost put me in debt right now) and I don't have anyone to ask in the area to stay with, and also don't want to expose anyone else in case I catch COVID in LA or during travel. (I could literally travel up there, do my appointment, and come back down, but it would be very hard on my body, and I would feel terrible without visiting when I feel like I have limited time left with my dad..) I will be aging out of my parents' insurance this year anyway and plan to be either under student healthcare or my partner's plan (insurance marriage, lol) by the end of the year. I'm thinking of holding off on taking care of my medical needs until the end of the year when I can hopefully switch to LA-based services. I was wondering if this sounds... logical given the situation right now, or if I am being too paranoid. I understand my condition would potentially suffer if I'm forgoing tests that would detect something abnormal right now, but I'm just too scared (and broke, tbh) to travel up there and potentially expose my parents. Thanks for listening, let me know if any further info is needed.",

I cant get free healthcare where I could talk to a doctor about my medical condition until I get my social security number, which isnt coming for another 8-12 weeks because theyre notoriously slow. Until I get that and my booster shot, Im worried that I could get COVID, so I dont want to join clubs or societies yet. I havent had a meaningful interaction with someone face to face in over 4 weeks. Even the short conversations Ive had at the grocery stores have been limited since the country Im in (Sweden) are known for not making small talk. This is all fine for me in non-COVID times, when Ill meet people, but right now Im struggling. I feel so alone. I love the country, but the lack of interaction with people is getting to me. I work so I have some conversation there, but its online so I cant even strike up a conversation at my desk or in the kitchen. Before now, I was living with my family, so I could talk to them when I needed to. I can still call them or even video call them, but its not the same. I even feel distant from my friends back home because most of them havent been great at keeping in touch during the pandemic and now its even worse. I just wanted to let it out. Thanks for reading.",

For instance just before COVID there was a trip I was invited on which I had declined thinking \"there will be another time\", and now it's been years since (among many other things I've foolishly put off). It's made me feel guilty for delaying a lot of things but most importantly makes me feel bad for working a job where I'm not appreciated and strongly dislike. I know the generic cliche advice is to look forward but I can't help but think about how I've spent a lot of time being treated poorly instead of doing what I enjoy, it's gotten worse recently and I'm extremely stressed out all the time from work. I had COVID about a month ago and they simply demanded I come back to work right away without any regard for how I am feeling, it's not a good feeling to know if you died they'd simply go \"ah shit need to post another job ad\". I guess my main grief isn't the conventional \"I am scared of permanent side effects of long covid/my relatives/family dying or suffering\" but rather that over the last little while it's really clicked just how fast time has gone by and how I've made very poor use of it. It's been keeping me up at night and really thinking about it most of the day. I try to do the right things that feel \"productive\" but it's always somewhere between the back and front of my mind and it goes from anger to sadness to anxiety to feeling of powerlessness.",

Turns out that on Sunday she saw a family friend who is now very sick with a high fever, cough, the whole deal. My partner tested negative on a rapid test yesterday before coming over, but Im not confident thats an accurate result based on the timeline. My question is this: is there any sense in having my partner isolate in a bedroom here at my house given that yesterday we were kissing, had sex, etc.? Like, wouldnt I already be exposed and thus have no reason to isolate? Or is it still sensible to have her isolate on the chance that I somehow havent already gotten it? Ive tried to research this but havent found a clear answer. Thanks for any advice you can provide.",

Had that cough for the rest of the month, very minor, until my sicknss peaked between 12/28-12/30 with a 10 hour fever, headache, fatigue, cough, sinus pressure, and sore throat. Got antibiotics and started to feel better. Did an at-home covid test and that came out negative. I still scheduled a PCR for 01/08. Well, that PCR came back positive yesterday, 01/11. I took 3 at-home covid tests (1 test I even swabbed my throat in addition to nostrils) last night. All negative. This whole time, I've been home majority of the time except for being on public transportation on 01/07. I'm boosted and was double masking but if I caught it, that's where I did. My wife has been testing negative during the same timeframe with both PCR and at-home tests. Basically I just want to ask, with omicron, can one test positive in less of 24 hours of possible exposure?",

After my booster yesterday, I started feeling unwell much more quickly, within half an hour, and went to bed. I woke up around 6am, the side effects were pretty intense. I felt so cold, yet clammy and hot too, the room was spinning and I felt very nauseous at times that I couldn't move. Sore throat with taste/smell are diminished (I tried a fruity antacid because my mouth felt strange). At times I felt short of breath, fortunately I have a pulse oximeter: 95% oxygen saturation at 100 BPM (at rest). I took Tylenol and Gravol and slept until 1:30pm. As the day has gone on, I am now feeling a bit better. The oximeter is now showing 97% at 76 BPM, seems more normal for being in bed. Of course now I'm not tired! The vaccine information slip they gave me, described \"mild\" side effects. I would not call my experience mild! I was sick in December with maybe-covid so I'm wondering if that has anything to do with my body's unhappy reaction today. I hope that whenever the next booster is, that it isn't any more intense than this. :/ Anyway, I'm very pleased to have got the vaccine, eventually I wabt to see my parents (been 2 years!).

Well when I saw it my opinion was a bit different. He is saying the world needs to be vaxxed. I agree with that. However, whether another variant comes or not depends on what happens. Also his talk of Omnicron is more nuanced: he says it is foolish to let people just try to take their chances with this particularly unvaccinated ones. But that does not mean vaccinations are ineffective. Still are. He still thinks the pandemic can end this year provided we vaccinate more in the world. That I agree with.

We're in a room that's probably about 80sqft, so a small and windowless space. We're both always masked(me with a kn95, her a surgical mask) and vaxxed(I'm also boosted). The reason it's possible is that she had a cold over the winter break that she could never get tested for, but might have been covid and that showed on the PCR. Her rapid test for re-entering school on Monday was negative. She's supposed to take another rapid test on Saturday, so we'll see how that goes. I'm not especially worried for myself. I'm triple vaxxed, 31, and healthy. My dilemma comes from living with my 70 year old mother and 66 year old, diabetic father. They're also triple vaxxed, and my dad's diabetes is actually pretty controlled, but obviously I want to protect them. Aside from masking around the house, and staying confined to my room as much as possible, is there anything I can do? In addition, because I'm triple vaxxed, currently negative, and asymptomatic, I'm still going into work, where I'm masked and staying inside our office, unless asked to cover a class because they're very short-staffed, unfortunately. Anything I can do to keep the kids safe? Any extra precautions I should take? I know the CDC doesn't recommend quarantine, just masking, is that.... fine? I'm not about to go to the movies, but maybe a drive-thru Starbucks or seeing my boyfriend fully masked for a minute this weekend.",

Long story short I was symptomatic from 12/26 to 12/31 and recently got done with my isolation last week. It was torture finally having some time off the same time as my wife and not being able to spend any of it in the same room. Today, my beloved wife (who took very good care of me while I was laid out) told me that a co worker tested positive today, and she was exposed to her (close quarter work for 2 hours) 2 days ago. We are not sure what the rules of engagement are if my wife does test positive. Would I be in the clear to still be in the same room as her? Since I just had Covid, would I be likely to be fine/immune even if I remained in close quarters with her? Prior to being infected, I was double vaxxed/boosted. If possible Id like to not go through the same thing again, but if I must, I must.",

They had me take a rapid test because I told them someone in my house was sick with a respiratory illness last week and I had been fatigued, achy and congested on and off up until early this week. So I got a negative. That wasn't very surprising seeing as I'm no longer fatigued or aching. I am congested on and off but nothing particularly notable. I do, however, have a double ear infection, something I haven't had since I was a kid. I was told this was likely due to a different illness clogging my eustachian tubes and preventing my sinuses/ears from draining properly, leading to infection. They said COVID couldn't be ruled out as the cause, despite the negative result. So take that as a cautionary tale for post-illness, I guess. If your ears hurt, see a doctor. But my question isn't \"did COVID do this to me\" because there's really no way of knowing if I had it or not at this point. My question is, should I consider myself safe for other people to be around, and should I get my booster when it's due at the end of the month? I don't want to put it off, but I want it to actually be useful.",

Yesterday all department employees went through PCR testing to discard the possibility of any cases after the holidays; a guy who sits in the cubicle next to me tests positive and we are told he has a high viral load, meaning hes extremely contagious. I tested negative, but, the lab said they detected a small viral load on my system and advised my office to sent me home and get tested again on Monday; I dont know what variant I had in November, but Im vaccinated (2 pfizer doses, last one on July 21); I havent been boosted because theres no access to boosters where I live (I actually have scheduled a booster for end of February). For reference, I disinfect my workspace every morning and wear a KN95 mask plus my prescription glasses everyday, plus I wash my hands multiple times a day. Mask only comes off on my lunch Hour, for about 15 minutes while I eat alone at my desk. Considering I tested negative, but the lab noted the presence of a small viral load; does this means Im going to develop COVID again? How worried should I be? So far I dont have any symptoms that would make me think I have this and yesterdays PCR was negative. Could that change?",

I was feeling fine today up until I was told that I had close contact with them and wouldn't you know, I immediately feel like my throat has that scratchy feeling--even though I hadn't felt it today.

I've heard from a couple of sources, probably doomer sources but anyway, that there is no guarantee that covid-19 will become milder with time and it's unlikely to become endemic in the future, i.e. this year or the next few years, simply due to this fact. Don't want this to be a doomer article but I'm really concerned how we can be \"living with covid\" like we live with all those other viruses if there's no guarantee it will become milder with time and the threat that a new variant will pop out of nowhere and send us back to square one, will always be there?",

How could it not? The one thing that worries me though is we know that the largest business interests can completely control policy due to their influence on politicians. Regardless of where they are in the political spectrum - right, left or center. So it's safe to say that the oil lobby will want to return to normalcy and they wield a lot of power. They want travel to come back, people to get into their cars and go places, and the manufacturing economy to start chugging along at full speed. Then you have the entities that actually benefit hugely in this pandemic phase: companies like amazon that have obliterated retail and keeping people out of malls only helps their business. Pharma companies that are rolling in cash not just for vaccines but for anything people want to take that they think might help them. I'm sure there are many others. When things go back to normal, amazon is going to see their record profits return to normal. So isn't the question - who has more power, the ones benefiting from this new normal, or those that want it to return to previous times?",

Ive had a few close contacts/exposures over last week and this week, the most recent one being Monday. I have a 6 month old baby so just for piece of mind really, I tested every day since. On Thursday morning I tested using an On/Go rapid test and it came back positive but with a really faint line, faint enough that I had to shine my light on it to see it. Trying not to panic, I wanted to be extra sure so I worked (from home) waited 8 hours and then took the other test out of that same box. This time, the positive line showed up a little more visible but at about minute 7 I noticed that the line was half gone. And by minute 10 it had completely disappeared. Confused and anxious, I took a different brand test (Quidel Quick View) and that came back negative after the ten minutes. I was feeling a little manic that day from all of the confusion and ended up digging that test out of the trash after about an hour and it looked like there was a positive line there, but it wasnt there the first time. Friday morning I tested negative and also Saturday I tested negative. Throughout this whole time I never had any symptoms except for a baseline morning headache and a bit of a dry throat that tends to go away by mid morning. I am currently waiting on PCR results to come back but they wont be here til Monday. What are your thoughts? Has anyone experienced this? Thanks in advance!!",

This may be the sole reason why this variant is the worst one yet. It can infect you no matter what vaccine you got, or how many times youve been vaccinated. An omicron specific vaccine would likely help, but our vaccine makers are too slow right now with this creation, and should have started making it back in November when this was discovered. It evades almost all immunity provided by vaccination. It does not evade T cells, however, and I personally feel we were really lucky we got away scot free with that. Nevertheless even being sick with Covid is not acceptable if youre boosted. 2. Transmissibility: this variant is almost as contagious as measles. You can get it even being masked with a cloth mask next to one other person, outside. To sum it up, this variant nearly brought us back to March 2020. We got really lucky, but we may not be so lucky the next Time. Currently, this is the worst variant of the pandemic. Virulence is moot when the other factors come into play.",

I have read from other user's posts and from friends that this is pretty consistent with people who had covid. I have since been quarantining from her, but I am curious if this cough could mean she is contagious still. I do realize it has been much longer than the CDC's guidelines in regards to both 5 and even 10 days, and I was wondering if I am just being overly cautious and that we are actually in the clear to see each other, kiss, etc. ;essentially carry on as normal.

I mean can we at the very least expect some stability in both the pandemic situation and restrictions for this year.

I've heard we can be optimistic about it becoming endemic, and hence living with it exactly like we've lived with the flu, this year. hHowever I've also heard there is no guarantee that will happen this year or even in the next few years. How reasonable is to expect that after this wave the situation will more or less be stabilized and society will settle on a base of restrictions and keep to that rather than yo-yoing in out of lockdowns/closures.

It started out, in the early days of the sub, as a place to post good news stories as a counter to all the media dooming. In retrospect, that may not have been the best idea as it took the good news stories out of being peppered through the sub, where they may have been more uplifting overall. So I don't want to go back to that. Then it sort of morphed into 'why this week's Mink mutation/variant isn't going to evade all vaccines/have a 20x higher fatality rate' whenever a(n inevitably overblown) news story threatened to take over the sub. Which is still going to be needed occasionally but not every week. I'm loathe to just let it fade away, as it's a good place to collate useful resources and links, like the ones below, but it would be nice for it to have more of a 'feel' or a reason to be updated every week. So, over to you. And ideas? 'Useful link of the week'? Online AmongUs sessions? r/COVID19_support movie stream night? Quiz night? Discussion evening - and if so, on COVID topics or something else? Let me know your thoughts. And, in the meantime, here's the old useful resources link that need somewhere to be parked: **HIGHLIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS STICKIES:** **Resources for students:** [[url] **For the latest information on the various new strains and their additional transmission/mortality rates, please stick to reliable news outlets:** [[url] [[url] [[url] **COVID19 Anxiety Workbook and other health anxiety resources** [[url] **Home hygiene during COVID19** [[url]",

        "Reddit Post": "So, I'm in my early 60's and a lung cancer survivor. In March of 2020 my PCP suggested that I not work in a retail grocery environment until the scope of Covid was known. After speaking with my manager I was put on Medical Leave of Absence which allowed me to keep and self pay for my healthcare. My wife and I went into hard lockdown. Mostly deliveries of food, although I did do a little shopping at TJ's when they used to have senior hours. Fast forward to June of 2021. The grocery store called and said I either had to return to work or resign. This was a corporate wide policy. I resigned. The COBRA premiums were $790 per month. While I still had some savings, this was really beyond my budget. In September I got a job with a very small company. I work as an electromechanical tech fixing receipt printers. I have never removed my mask while in the building. Lunch? In my car. Sip of tea? Step outside. Snack or fruit? Step outside. On the 7th of this month one of my colleagues was in the same room as I and started to have a coughing fit. He ripped his mask OFF and coughed for 10 or 15 seconds. It must have been in that brief moment that he infected me. When I showed to work the next he was not in. I scheduled a PCR test and thankfully was able to schedule one for that Friday. When I woke that morning I had some unexplainable aches and pains. I was at work, but following my test appointment I went home. That night I had coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and a slight fever. It was either Thursday or Friday that I infected my wife. She has similar symptoms, but she has also lost senses of taste and smell. I cannot say just how angry I am at me colleague. Maybe it was the way I was brought up, but if I have a coughing fit I cover my mouth, not rip a protective barrier off. Anyway, just wanted to rant a little bit, thanks for reading.",

I contracted Omicron and 10 days ago started to experience symptoms and have been isolating since (also the time of my first positive rapid test). Today I still have minor symptoms: some congestion and a slight cough. I decided to give myself a rapid test since reading online that as long as you do not have any fever symptoms for 24hrs after day 10 of isolation you can go back to life as normal. So my rapid test was negative and I'm wondering now if it's ok for me to go back to work and be out in the community tomorrow. I can't find any information regarding this topic online, so any help would be appreciated.",

I'm vaxxed, boosted, etc. However: Boy, do I need a hug. I haven't touched another human in 2 years. I moved to a new city at the start of the pandemic, which turned out to be the worst time possible. With everything being closed most of the time, I haven't been able to build any kind of social life here. I miss physical closeness so much. With social distancing still being strongly encouraged and sometimes mandated where I live, how will I experience hugs? I've read the advice to get a pet, or get a weighted blanket, etc. Well, pets aren't allowed in my apartment, and I do have thick blankets which are very comfy, but... they're in no way are a substitute for real human touch. Also, while I understand masking has been necessary to combat the spread of covid, it has had a profound psychological impact on me. I guess because all you see is people's eyes. You don't see their mouths when they talk, you just hear voices. You don't see facial expressions, you don't see smiles. Everybody's face is hidden behind a mask, like they're a potential threat. It makes going out into the world, into the city, such an impersonal, closed off experience, at least it does to me. Like it's even harder to connect with other people. Maybe I'm weird. &amp;#x200B; Maybe this is more of a rant than anything. It's just that covid restrictions, social distancing, mask mandates, can't go away soon enough. I wish to be able to truly connect and be close with other people irl again.",

I miss being able to frequently go to malls, restaurants, and places I've never been to before without the worry of catching the virus. I just find myself constantly reminiscing about good memories, which makes me feel a little bit better. This pandemic has ruined my mental state and led me to burnout. I mean, the constant loneliness and boredom FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR would make anyone insane. At first I loved quarantine because I thought this was just gonna last until 2021 and there was no school. But now with online classes and the pandemic still going on? It just, makes me feel burnt out. There could've been so many opportunities for me if it wasn't for this pandemic. Back before the pandemic, I was this energetic, smart, and promising kid full of potential, but now, I'm this miserable guy who does nothing but browse the internet all day. It's unbelievable how things have gotten this bad in just a span of one or maybe two years. Despite all of that, I still feel optimistic, that one day once all of this is over, I'm gonna be able to go back to the places that I've always wanted to go back to, get more opportunities, and of course, rebuild my life to the life that I had before the pandemic, but this time an improved one, as I've learned a lot about life during the pandemic, so that's a plus I guess. But until then, I guess I'm gonna try my best to fill the dark void of my life. In other words, I'm gonna try to be more productive and get more hobbies, with the good memories I've made in the past motivating me.",

What are the rules in your country and how are you trying to work with or around them? Do you feel more optimistic or not about the coming months ahead? I know some people feel that with being triple vaxxed they feel more laid back and confident to do things and live life despite the situation (following local rules of course) whereas some are much more worried and hesitant of the virus, or somewhere inbetween, all of which are very understandable but I can imagine affect one differently mentally and how they view the situation. Personally I'm living quite normally now, I wear a mask in shops if its required and I cant go out partying as much as I want as the bars are shut but otherwise for me covid is now pretty much a frustrating nuisance than a huge roadblock. I'm triple vaxxed as are most people I know and I'm not particularly fazed anymore about catching it, if it gets me it gets me and I accept that. Perhaps because of this, I do feel very optimstic looking ahead now, things do feel like they are slowly getting better. What about you though?",

My mother also became positive last year and she had rough symptoms, she was hospitalized for a day but she still wouldn't take a vaccine after she recovered. Just recently, my mother called me, screaming and crying her lungs out, asking me why I took a vaccine. She was CONVINCED I was gonna die. I swear I could hear her tossing stuff in her house, the call went on for half an hour. She eventually just hung up. I thought it would end there, but I later had a call from my aunt, saying my mother is talking about selling our house and my stuff to save up for \"funeral services\". Sounds ridiculous, I know. As far as I know, she hasn't done anything yet but knowing how deeply she believes all these stupid crap about the vaccines, she might actually do it. The whole situation is so crazy and laughable that I just don't know how to deal with it. Do I just ignore her and wait for her to calm down? I actually considered visiting her but I believe Japan has travel ban, so that's out of the question. I actually don't know how my mother found out about me getting my second dose, my only guess is she infiltrated my Facebook account somehow.",

The past 4 days have been a vicious cycle of forcing myself to eat maybe 2 meals a day and then by the late afternoon, I start getting nauseous and then anxiety kicks in and I really cant eat then. Exa: I had oatmeal with strawberries this morning then around 2 pm I had a vegan chicken sandwich (which tasted like burning flesh since I have slight Parosmia atm). I always intend on eating dinner but just cant get myself to do it because I am nauseous 24/7 and the thought of eating makes me want to gag. My feet are ice cold 24/7 and my hands are too. I am plenty hydrated and drink liquid IV to make sure I have plenty of electrolytes. I also eat fruit every day. Has anyone else experienced this and does it eventually go away? Im so devastated lately as I seemed to get the WORST post covid symptoms despite me being double vaccinated. I have never dealt with anxiety, loss of appetite, etc in my life. I was so happy and outgoing. I have at least 2 panic attacks a day and tell my parents how I feel. They dont care much and think the smell and taste thing is overreacting and will go away. Maybe it will, but as of now it hasnt, and theres a chance it never will. Im scared because I desperately need to gain weight again but healthy foods dont really have high calorie counts. I cant eat processed stuff rn as it tastes disgusting. For reference, Im 51, so 95 pounds may not seem terrible, but for me that is significant weight loss and it scares me.",

I work from home every day and I know there are folks who need the tests for work, travel, school, etc., so I dont feel like I should get tested. If anything, waiting in line for a test for 3 hours could expose me and cause me to have it.

She received antibodies and dealt with the recovery well enough. Then, in August of last year, she wound up getting vaccinated. And as stated, things seem much less troubling than last time. I clearly remember the first infection being hard to deal with. Now, I just feel a tad worn down. I'm assuming it's the same with my mother.",

I see posts like these and I get confused (the blue and yellow figures are today's report on deceased vaccinated/boosted; red figures are deceased unvaccinated) [[url] According to the Dept. of Health of Puerto Rico: **91.9%** of the total population has at least a dose of the vaccine, **80.2%** of which are fully-vaccinated. We had been doing great before Omicron (keeping infection rate at 2% I believe... it is now at 30+%). [[url] There is so much information going on that I am having trouble making sense of it. Essentially people are worried that vaccines are causing issues or not working or something else is going on because these posts show more vaccinated people dying than unvaccinated. I would like to figure out how that translates with the high vaccinated population we have. Let me do some math (please correct this if it's wrong; I'm not great at math and am using a formula I found online): If we have 80.2% (**2,509,034** people) fully vaccinated, of which 15 died today, that means: **(15/2,509,034) x 100% =** **0.00000597839** fully-vaccinated people died today out of the total of fully vaccinated crowd. If we have 19.8% (2,509,034 - 3,076,212 of total people = **567,178)** unvaccinated, of which 6 died today, that means: **(6/567,178) x 100% =** **0.00001057868** people unvaccinated died today of the total of the unvaccinated crowd. I need to believe vaccines are working.",

Without adding too much detail, is it that much to ask family who will be spending a week under the same roof to do a covid test? Following a huge deal being made of me making that request, I went and had a meal out at a restaurant indoors. My dads wife then turned it into a massive deal claiming we dont even care about covid at all, just wanted to create drama. She actually kicked my five month old baby, myself, and my fianc out of their home the day before thanksgiving. In the uk we test loads before being in each others homes.. We also dont then hide under a rock.. as in we eat at restaurants- ideally outdoors but not entirely.. and we go to grocery stores. For me its viewed as mitigating risk. I cant and wont live under a rock now that Ive lived through several lock downs but where I can help it I try to test as a part of a mitigation strategy. Their family arent vaccinated and dont take covid very seriously..",

However, she thinks that is some kind of shield that makes her more strong against any virus and now doesn't take any precautions at all. No more masks, works at a convenience store where she could be infected by anyone, and now she has decided to take a couple hour road trip in a closed car with someone who just last week sounded a lot like she had the virus, but wasn't tested, so it's hard to know. I just want to be able to relax and forget about it. I've done everything I can to protect myself, but with her constantly exposing herself to the virus, it's hard. And no, I can't move or throw her out as we both share the rent and neither can afford to pay the rent alone, especially me who has gotten ill with other problems and lost my insurance. I've tried convincing her, but she always says \"You got to die sometime.\" and brushes me off. I'm actually surprised she at least went and got the vaccine and booster at the same time I did at least. From what I hear, boosted people aren't really getting bad symptoms from it, so I'm wondering if I'm just being panicked over what could wind up being no worse than a bad cold (something I may already have had a few weeks ago around Christmas)? I have so many issues in my life these days that I can't afford any more panicking or I'll die from heart problems long before Omicron gets me.

For various reasons, I rarely visit the doctors, even when I'm injured. It's irresponsible, I know, and I'm not looking for criticism towards that specifically. Regardless, I had frequent irregular heart rhythms (and shortness of breath) for more than a week after each time I was vaccinated, which made my job extremely hard. Worse for me is that I am extremely physically active, my job is physically active, I am a healthy weight, I have never drunk alcohol, taken drugs, smoked, or consumed any other harmful substance, so a profound feeling of impending doom loomed over me during those times. And no, I didn't go to the doctor, and I will defer to the doctor for advice on whether I should continue to get these vaccinations as a last resort. I don't watch or read news, nor do I have have a phone or a TV. I'm not on any social media excluding reddit, and rarely comment here. I find myself easily overwhelmed by information, so I've chosen to avoid all of it that doesn't come through my mailbox. It's hard for me to get doctors appointments in recent years, especially since my local surgery moved to mobile apps to make appointments. All of my interactions are professional, otherwise I'm completely alone, I have no friends and have no support structure or contact with family. Please advise, I'm afraid. Should I get the booster, knowing that I experienced these symptoms? Has anyone received any advice with these symptoms post-vaccination? Note: Throwaway because my employer knows my main.",

Now, Covid can't be 100% be ruled out by the test. The fever friend also has no known exposure to Covid though has been suffering from pandemic fatigue so hasn't been vigilant post-vaccination. The friend also loves having people over so exposure could be through an asymptomatic person. It could be the flu. Both partner and I are fully vaccinated/boosted for covid and flu. But I have had a really bad experience with the flu years ago while vaccinated that I would never want to relive again. There are specific Covid isolation guidelines, but is it prudent to use them for illness symptoms without verification of whether it is Covid, flu, bad cold, or some other virus?

Got my positive result Jan 13 via NHS. My isolation is over and feel absolutely fine now but still testing positive on RATs/LFTs. In order to enter Canada, one must have either a negative PCR -or- positive PCR from 11+ days ago. Am now flying home on Jan 29 which will be 11+ days from my positive test BUT: -NHS tests are apparently not acceptable for travel (the result email has all information e.g. Name, DOB, Test Date but does not have address of test provider) If do a private PCR next week (this is the acceptable type), there's a chance it's going to be positive and positive for a long time and apparently starts my isolation all over again. Have made a telephone appointment with my doctor in Canada to see if he can get me a letter confirming I'm fit for travel. But have no idea if this will be accepted with the NHS positive result and terrified of being fined at the border. With the airline I'm flying with, flights to Canada are only happening once a week. Feel angry, frustrated and upset. Why is this so hard?! Since the beginning, I have tried so hard to do everything right, stay safe and keep others safe. Now just want to go home. According to the science, I'm past the transmission stage so why can't just go home? Has anyone had a similar experience? What did you have to do? At this point, I think my best bet is to do a private PCR for the positive result and move my flight again. Not ideal, especially when I've just started a new job! I'm fortunate enough to work from home and can work whilst I'm here, but it's not the same when you don't have all your equipment and setup. My brain is not firing on all cylinders at the moment.

Its like 2020 all over, he kept us in for the entire year until the vaccine was available. His excuse for keeping us in the house is bc of my asthma which is pretty severe. Im in California and omicron is pretty bad rn but he makes it seem like if we get the virus well just instantly die. Its like why get vaccinated and boosted if I cant do anything with my gf or family. I understand covid is bad and how it affects everyone differently but i hate how he is the most healthiest one in the family rarely gets sick but is the most scared. He doesnt wanna see family or his friends. Before omicron whenever we go out and stuff hell make us feel guilty. My 15 yr old niece cant even go to school or hang with friends because of him and thats really keeping her back socially. The last time I went out with my gf was Dec 17th and idk how long I can stay in this house.",

I'm still really scared though. My grandma told me she read that it will be fine but i dont trust their reading. Is it safe for me to shower there? Also, an update on my own health, since last time I posted a lot of people nagged me to get tested and isolate. I had a couple days of scratchy throat and drainage, but I bought a humidifier for my room and that helped IMMENSELY. like, within an hour my throat was perfectly fine and my drainage had improved a lot. It took a couple days for my system to get back to normal, but I'm fine now. I figure it wasnt covid because covid wouldn't have gotten better so quickly.",

        "Reddit Post": "My 30 year old wife is double vaccinated since about 5 months ago, and has recently had Covid with semi mild symptoms (worse than a common cold, but nowhere near going-to-hospital sickness). Her symptoms ended about 3 days ago. And today she got an SMS telling her that she now can book an appointment for her booster shot. Is it medically more advantageous to get the booster shot as soon as possible, even this short time after she had Covid? Or is it better to wait a while (like a few weeks or months), since her body has boosted it's own immune system when fighting the infection? I also got Covid (PCR verified), shortly after my wife. And in my case I had actually taken the booster shot shortly before getting sick, as in 3 days before. Does the closeness of my booster shot and my infection change anything for me? Will my protection be just as strong, and last just as long, compared to if I hadn't had Corona? Or might it improve my protection, or worsen it? The Corona information websites in our home country (Sweden) doesn't really say much about these things, and when googling there seems to be mixed information.",

I go to school and, over the period of a day, I was seated about 1m away from a person who later got covid symptoms (their family was positive) for about an hour in total. Both times were in big, ventilated rooms and we were both masked. I normally would be freaking out about an exposure but this person is veeeery quiet (never said anything to me, never spoke in the entire time we were seated next to each other). I was wondering what the risk is, if we were both masked and there was no coughing/talking/sneezing. Thank you!",

She does not get help for these issues and makes no effort to work through her behaviors, blaming shitty insurance coverage. She doesn't even see a regular doctor despite the fact that she has multiple chronic disorders that badly need to be treated-- again, this is due to her health anxiety. She also will not get vaccinated. She wants everyone in the house to be vaccinated (which, we are) but says that her anxiety makes her exempt from it. I at first tried being empathetic, had some talks with her about it, and hoped she'd come to a point where she fears COVID more than the vaccine. However, the opposite is true. She scares herself incessantly with medical articles about side effects from the vaccine and worries she'll die if she gets it. She ended up getting COVID after my dad and I got it. The entire time, I was worried she was going to die or be hospitalized due to the state of her health. Thankfully, she's ok, but her anxiety has now consumed her-- it's been weeks since and she will barely leave her room, disinfects everything, etc. She keeps me back from things in life because she wants me to protect her since she's unvaccinated. She won't allow me to see friends or get a new job. I don't see family or anything of the sort either. I'm very miserable and depressed, I love her but the untreated anxiety feels like a burden. I feel fatigued and I can't offer much empathy anymore. At some point her mental health is her responsibility. What can I do to help this situation... if anything? I'm so scared for her health.....",

If the potential long term effects of COVID were things like joint pains, lung damage, and altered taste, and nothing else, I might be able to live with that. But the idea of me one day never being able to focus or remember things properly to the point where I'll never be able to find work or even do simple things like driving (which I love to do by the way) or even take a shower without feeling like I'll pass out for three days afterwards, is absolutely ***terrifying.*** But the worst part? The initial onset of symptoms doesn't seem to matter for your chances of getting neurological Long COVID. There have been reports of people with asymptomatic cases developing the condition. Scientists can't even seem to come to an agreement on how common Long COVID is, even though they've been monitoring this disease for two god damn years. I've seen reports of it ranging from 10% to 30% of all cases, and almost none of them give out data of how common it is for vaccinated patients. Even Chise, someone on Twitter that I've always looked to for reassurance, didn't do much when she posted data of how common Long COVID is for vaccinated patients, simply because it contradicts everything else that I had seen to this point, and my brain just doesn't know what to trust more. From what I've read, I'm at risk for neurological Long COVID. I may not have anything serious like Schizophrenia or Bi-Polar Personality Disorder, but my brain is still a hot mess of Pure-O, Anxiety, and possibly Autism and ADHD, almost all of which puts me at a higher risk. So...hooray me. The media seems to be putting more focus on Long COVID since Omicron's fatality rate seems to have gone down the toilet, which is only exacerbating my anxieties about it more. I hate this so much. Why couldn't this virus just been another respiratory infection and nothing else?",

I've been extremely hesitant and always finding a way to scare myself from getting an appointment, and our parents haven't fully decided on getting the little ones jabbed.. I think it's almost unavoidable that we catch this virus, despite her now staying in her room. What makes Omicron different than Delta? I've suffered with Delta and it hospitalized me with pneumonia for a week, which makes me absolutely terrified that a reinfection will make me worse than before, but I've always been hearing how this variant isn't as deadly. But, why? Does it not attack your lungs? Is this variant just similar to battling a cold? Can Omicron still bring you pneumonia? Again, I apologize for the silly questions, but I just want to know what to expect with this variant?",

I keep reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is sort of a pointless risk- why risk the side-effects of the booster when it won't even help me? But I also think, are the other/older variants (delta, original Covid) still in circulation? Maybe I should get vaccinated to protect against them? I don't know. I have already taken the first 2 doses of the <ORG> vaccine, and I took my second dose back in July 2021. I had little to no side effects. I was well enough to keep working. But I've always dreaded getting the vaccines because of the possible side-effects. I am a late thirties male in normal health and normal weight. I feel like if I have to risk side effects like myocarditis, it has to be worth it. I work from home and only leave to go shopping, so I feel like my chances of catching covid are relatively low. So my questions are As a late 30s male: * Do I risk side effects of the booster that has low efficiency against omicron? * Or should I wait for the vaccine that is customized to it? * Or should I take the booster because the older more dangerous variants are still circulating? Any advice is appreciated",

Well time went on and the internet became a bigger and bigger part of my life, today my prevalent forms of socialization are discord servers and vtubers, at this point I feel like I am not able to connect in real life even if I wanted to (and the fact that I literally cant dosent help that much). and its bound to get even worse since I am going to graduate this year, I will be in a profession where I will work alone. So yeah, even if covid ends tomorrow it already broke me, it seems all of this situation has made me less of a human, only able to form connections though a damm screen.",

However, my past few visits to Twitter have had a severe impact on my mental health. Eight times out of ten, whenever I search Twitter for Covid news, I get bombarded with doomer tweets that say things like the world of 2019 will never return or we will always have to revolve our lives around Covid or you will always have to prove your vax status and wear a mask wherever you go for the rest of your life. Even though I know that the people saying these things are lying, I cant help but feel depressed when I read these things. 2019 was one of the best years of my life. I started college, made a new group of friends, got my drivers permit, and got autographs from some of my favorite voice actors at AnimeNYC. To hear people say that well never be able to experience those days again just sounds so disheartening to someone like me. I just wish there was a way to stop my urge to scroll through Twitter, or at least stop myself from coming across the tweets that are making me feel miserable.",

She drank plenty of water this time around, and my brother mentioned that when she got up to make her coffee in the morning she sat back down and felt woozy and passed out. Shes fine and feeling better thank god, and an ambulance was called that ran vitals that were in fact normal. Im just happy shes fine, and now shes fully vaccinated.

We are all generally pretty good about taking Covid seriously, which includes wearing masks and getting the vaccine. Back in April, we attended the funeral of my mother-in-laws sister, which took place in a small rural town a few hours away where Covid is not taken seriously at all. When the funeral took place, my in-laws were fully vaccinated but I was only partially vaccinated. We get to the funeral, which was held indoors with probably 75-100 people present, and not a soul in there was wearing a mask, except me. For whatever reason, my family members decided to drop their precautions and go along with the majority consensus of the group and forget about Covid. I was very troubled by this, so the next morning I texted some of them and asked why they did not wear masks. I made a point to not bother texting my mother-in-law, though, because she had just buried her sister, after all. So I texted my father-in-law, and he did not take too kindly to the question. He said he felt it wasnt appropriate or necessary to wear a mask under the circumstances and that each person had to make their own decision. This was quite baffling to me because all of a sudden my father-in-law was starting to sound like the type of person you hear about who downplays Covid, even though hes happy to criticize people in other contexts when they disregard Covid safety protocols. I pointed out to him that CDC guidelines, at the time, stated that you should still wear masks, even when fully vaccinated. Anyway, he clearly told my mother-in-law that I posed this question, because I just found out that she is still upset, 4 months later, that I would even ask in the aftermath of her sisters funeral. My question is, was I correct to bring up the question? In my view, the virus doesnt care about what setting we are in so we should take precautions regardless. Or should I have just kept my mouth shut? How do you deal with Covid safety at an event where emotions are high?",

It came back as faintly positive, but positive. That night I had the worse headache I ever had and my joints were killing me and a fever. I tested at home again and it was bright pink positive so I went from quarantining in my house to a specific room. 9/7 rolls around and I submit my covid tests to my work. They say this does not count, I have to go to an approved facility. So I find one and go get tested late 9/7. Today 9/8 I receive my results as a negative PCR test. So on record I never had it. My question is did I have it, do I have it, and should I still quarantine. Does one negitive PCR out weight symptoms and two positive Antigens? Or does the 4 days apart between the two tests negate everything? I was positive but since I have the vaccine I quickly got rid of it. My 11yr old daughter who is very sick tested positive on the antigen also and negitive the same day on the PCR. To add to this I do have <ORG> vaccine back in April/May time frame. Not sure if this could effect the results between the the tests.",

Epidemiologists have oddly learned that testing viral loads of municipal sewage is a remarkably accurate predictor of what will happen with cases, about a week in advance. This is proposed to be because this provides a comprehensive sample that includes asymptomatic cases, those that avoid healthcare or rely on non reported home tests, and may reflect viral loads. This correlation has proven accurate in many many municipalities across the last two years and therefore is increasingly more trusted. Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen. In the US they seem to have peaked and are falling. In this one article the slope seems to be falling really fast. [url] [url] More info about how and why this is done: [url]",

Do I need to contact anyone or take a PCR test to confirm or just stay at home and quarantine? So far, it's nothing that I can't handle....",
