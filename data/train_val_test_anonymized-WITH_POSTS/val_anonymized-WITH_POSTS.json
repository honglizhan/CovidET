In the sf Metro area we have 65 fully vaccinated, and some parts of it like sf have 68.9 fully vaccinated of whole population. And yet the delta is still surging here. The cdc just said in areas with high transmission masks should be mandated again and I feel completely hopeless. It's so far unknown if the bay area will reimplement masks but I'm sure they will. It's been close too 2 weeks since LA reinstated masks and the cases are still exploding there which is pretty hopeless. I can just see another lockdown coming maybe in the winter.",

I really want him to get vaccinated with the new delta variant going around and covid cases going up again in our area. Hes not in the at-risk group, but Ive still had nightmares about the what-if scenarios. When Ive talked to him he reiterates that hes unsure about how new the covid vaccine is. I understand that completely, but personally, Id rather be vaccinated especially with the lack of masks in our area. I dont want to push the subject too much as I know getting vaccinated is a personal decision, but I still dont sleep well at night knowing hes going to work unmasked, unvaccinated, and interacting with people. Maybe I just need to accept the fact he doesnt want to get the vaccine and find ways to combat my anxiety surrounding his vaccination - but Id still like to know if anyone has suggestions on how to talk to loved ones who arent vaccinated about getting the vaccine without being pushy or overbearing. Or if anyone has successfully convinced a loved one to get the vaccine?",

My arm hurts so much more than I thought it would, but other than that, I can't say anything of note has happened. I'm grateful for that. That said... All this news about the delta variant and vaccine resistant strains being a possibility is really beginning to scare and upset me. I'm having a really hard time keeping my cool. I do truly believe this can't go on forever, and I'm willing to force myself to get through the emotional toll of lockdowns and mask mandates... but I'm so scared of losing my life to a vaccine resistant strain. It's hard not to be furious at the antivaxxers all the time. Someone in my extended family is going to die very soon as a result of catching the delta variant as an unvaccinated person. They are already brain dead, but still on life support as of last night. Their spouse also has it, and is refusing to go to the hospital despite probably needing to be put on oxygen. It's so terrible. All of this is so terrible. I'm really scared of dying from a new strain. I know they're talking boosters, but what if it's not enough?

Right now, my state (NJ) is not allowing a virtual option. If I feel it is in his best interest, I will homeschool for the fall and re-enroll him when hes fully vaccinated. But with higher vaccination rates in NJ, precautions in school like masks and desk shields, etc., am I overreacting and putting my kid at a social disadvantage to his peers for what is a relatively low risk of infection? Saying that sounds crazy to me, though, considering the disadvantage he would be at if he did contract the virus and suffered long-term effects or death, God forbid.

That being said, we all had mild symptoms and none of us were hospitalized. None of us have underlying conditions and we all live very healthy lifestyles. Because I've had covid already and I'm incredibly low risk for ever being hospitalized (I literally have antibodies and have had the disease already, which thankfully did not land me or my loved ones in the hospital), I really do not understand why I need to get the vaccine. I understand that I can have renewed, stronger protection as I had it a while ago and the antibodies induced by vaccines can generate a stronger immune response than natural antibodies, but I am just not really afraid of getting covid. If it were a matter of lowering transmission, that's a moot point because it has been shown that people with breakthrough infections have viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated. As such, the only reason to get the vaccine is to protect yourself from hospitalization and/or death. I am not anti-vaxx and I think high risk individuals definitely should get the vaccine. However, I don't understand why I should risk potential side effects (even if they're rare) at this time. I do think we should do more to get high risk individuals in other countries vaccinated as well - I should not be a priority at all. If someone could explain to my why I'm wrong / misguided, I would really appreciate it.",

I feel like no matter where I look, where it be on the CDC website, WHO, newspapers, TV, from coworkers/friends/family, everyone seems to have a different idea of whats going on. Like is the vaccine not working?? Or maybe just not as effective against Delta? If I get the Delta variant, even as a fully vaccinated individual, is it not going to help? I know these questions might sound stupid but Im getting extremely contradicting answers. I was just starting to feel a bit more comfortable being out again.

Saw that Delta Plus was trending and saw an article (which I couldnt read because it was behind a damn paywall) mentioning how South Korea (if memory serves me right?) found two cases of a so called Delta Plus variant even MORE transmissible than the regular Delta one. Needless to say Im spiralling. I was already having a very rough week in regards to the regular old Delta variant and was doing ok in terms of trying to avoid news and then this happens. I was feeling so hopeful after my second dose of vaccine and felt this almost euphoric wave rush over me knowing Im protected and now theres all this doubt with the variants and Im worrying that the vaccines wont help (which Im pretty sure is bullshit and anxiety talking but I keep doubting myself lol). I even finally got a job and have my first shift this Saturday which I only felt comfortable doing because things where I am SEEMED to be getting better (Canada, Ontario) and now not only am I shitting myself for my first shift Im also scared of being indoors on a busy traffic day with all these new people. I guess Im looking for reassurance and some hope. Its almost like I feel like I cant be excited for my new job or how other things in my life have been looking up because Covid risks taking it all away. Im trying very hard to stay positive but when I avoid news or try to think positive my brain SCREAMS that I need to be researching any and everything about this new variant shit or Im in danger lol. It also doesnt help that, at least in my opinion or experience, that a lot of the news and rumours about these variants and their effectiveness is so damn confusing and contradicting what I thought already to be true. Im seeing new efficacy rates (regarding the vaccine) everywhere, and its really scaring me honestly. THERE ABSOLUTELY IS OBVIOUSLY A POINT TO GETTING VACCINATED, and that goes without saying, but Id be lying if I said Im not thinking about how it FEELS worthless and like nothing matters seeing as new variants are showing up.",

Experts constantly warn of super spreading events and we should all wear a mask still. If the vaccine doesn't allow us to resume normal life what does? Why can't we just give up at this point and learn to live with it? I feel as if the experts had their way certain things would be permanently banned. I have a trip planned next month to Orlando and my parents think i should cancel it because I could be a carrier even though I got the vaccine after that which furthers my belief this will never end and this is just how things will be from now on. A day will never come when I don't have to hear about Covid or the vaccine on the news and certain events will just disappear out of fear of one virus. I don't know what to think anymore and truly feel like this is just life now. Masks and constant cancelations. If im being irrational sorry but I had to get this out there.",

Ever since Ive come home from university this spring, I have been constantly worried about them being unvaccinated. At the moment, they have their first doses of <ORG>. Throughout this whole thing this spring they were expressing a lot of doubt about information circulating around Covid. They mask when they go places, and they continue to practice social distancing. But I was worried they werent going to get it because of fear that it hasnt been long enough to know side effects. They felt unable to get the vaccine earlier this summer because we have been caring for my grandma in our house and would be unable to take care of her if they had bad reactions to the vaccine. My sister and I have been vaccinated since early spring. I live with them at home during the summer, and even though they have had at least one dose, they have really been pushing my anxiety as of late. They booked a vacation in another state in an area where cases are very high. No one is masking. Ive been in a panic all week. They know I feel really uncomfortable being here, and told me they were going to be safe and wear masks and social distance. All week they have been forgetting to wear masks indoors and converse with people who arent masked. If this hasnt made me anxious enough, today my mom came home with a headache and my first thought was panic because of the delta variant. I cant afford to get sick because I have school and work in a week. Plus my birthday is coming up and my boyfriend is going to stay with us, so Im freaking out right now that they might get sick. How do I stop being so anxious about this?",

The other is my baby cousins mom, who at least wears a mask but is overall really lax about safety protocols. She thinks the vaccine will have long term effects and was made too fast. She believes a lot of conservative/right-wing BS. Im terrified shell get it and infect my baby cousin. What can I do to get through to them?

For preface, my partner and I thought it would be safe to travel to do a long overdue visit to her parents since we were all double vaxxed. We didn't go out anywhere adventurous during our stay. Mostly stayed at the house.Fast forward to the flight back. Needless to say, the Newark airport was a nightmare and crazy packed with people. My partner and I double masked and kept alcohol wipes in our backpacks. But our flight was basic &amp; pretty packed. I couldn't ignore some sneezy child and coughing passengers and always assume the worst; We made sure to wipe down our backpacks after getting off the plane &amp; wipe down the luggages. But how safe are planes with circulating the air? I've heard the horror stories of an entire flight catching the virus... Should we have worn gloves &amp; eye shields?? I'm now back in the office double masked, sitting in front of an AC on full blast, my throat feels dried, maybe I haven't drank enough water. My head aches a little..maybe it's because of the back-to-back meetings now that we're all back in the office for the first time since the pandemic. Sorry I'm internally going crazy of all these small \"what if\" just because of the flight coming back. These small things like a dried throat and mild headache only started when I returned working in the office 2 days after the return flight. Today feeling pretty normal other than mild dried throat.",

        "Reddit Post": "So here's the world's worst math question. Any advice would be greatly appreciated: We are currently a household of 2 vaccinated adults, 1 unvaccinated adult, and 5 children ages 3-11. Its a small house, so no isolating from one another was possible. On Friday July 30th my husband started having symptoms. My unvaccinated 7 year old niece also had some very mild symptoms. On Saturday July 31st my husband and I both got Covid tests. He came back positive, I came back negative. On Sunday August 1st, I started having some very mild symptoms and the unvaccinated adult (my sister in law) started having more significant symptoms. My 10 year old niece developed a cough that she still currently has, although its gotten better. On Tuesday August 3rd, the 5 year old mentioned that her throat felt funny. The 11 year old mentioned a mild headache and some stuffiness. The 3 year old never showed symptoms or reported anything because hes 3. On August 9th, the unvaccinated sister in law returned a negative covid test. However, on August 10th she visited a walk-in clinic and returned a positive covid test. None of the children have been tested. The sister in law still has a cough as does the 10 year old. When is safe for the adults to leave isolation? When is it safe for the children?",

Well guess what, that light turned out to be an oncoming train, just like I feared. Thanks to this fucking Delta variant, our progress against this fucking virus is getting wiped out, and I cant take another year of this. All this isolation, distancing, sacrificing, and whatnot was supposed to buy time to develop a vaccine. Instead, the goalposts keep moving. Vaccines were supposed to bail us out of this shit, not be an extra burden. If vaccines dont eliminate the need for masking/distancing/canceling events, why would Joe Blow Schmuckatelli take time out of his working schedule to get vaccinated? Never get my hopes up *ever again*. This sub has given me false hope only to punch me in the dick. Its better to be a pessimist and be pleasantly surprised than to be an optimist and be constantly disappointed.",

Saturday morning I'm about halfway through the four hour drive and she calls me to say her throat is kind of sore, she goes and gets a rapid test and the result is negative. I figure it's just a cold, I mean we're vaccinated after all. We spend the whole weekend together and her sore throat turns into a cough and full blown cold symptoms. She has two more tests through out the week (both rapid and pcr) and both come back negative. Fast forward to today, I feel a tickle in my throat and constant mucus drip coming down...as a precaution I text my boss and say I have to work from home today. My throat got worse throughout the day, and even though she tested negative three times now I figure I may as well get tested myself. I almost didn't know what to say when the doctor came back in and said \"well hey I'm sorry I really was hoping I'd have better news for you, but you have covid\". The next hour of my day was spent texting everyone I've stupidly been in contact with in the past week, coworkers, friends, family. I can't help but feel like if any of them come down with covid it is absolutely my fault, I went and visited someone I knew had some sort of bug and still did not quarantine because they tested negative, I've never felt so selfish in my life. I'm not looking to be coddled and told it isn't my fault, I more just am looking for a place to get this off my chest.",

I booked it a few months ago when the cases were low and now the cases are really high and I dont know if I should cancel as Im meant to leave in three days and I have severe anxiety. I am double vaccinated (<ORG>) but I got my second dose all the way back in March and I heard about this new study that says that I could get a breakthrough infection and that new study from Israel about symptomatic infection chances is very worrying (39% protective?! [[url] I'm mainly worried about getting a breakthrough infection that leads to long covid as I couldnt imagine going through that but Im worried that Im going to let my friend down who Im meant to go with as they will have to lose the money for the flights and hotel too. The friend is not vaccinated and Im worried that this poses an additional risk. Am I being over-dramatic or is it a bad idea to go? Edit: Im 21 and I have no underlying conditions and Im female if that helps at all.",

My cousin said it's been \"at least two weeks\" since they had symptoms, but I know for a fact that her mother, who lives across the street from her, is still battling coronavirus (they are a very close family). I found my kids playing with their kids and instructed them not to play since they had the virus go through their house. It's completely put me on edge and ruined the whole evening. We left early.

I don't want to sound like a 10 year old in the backseat of his/her parent's car yelling: \"Are we there yet?\" but everything seems so far away and so apotheotic that I don't know anymore. Uncertainty has certainly been consuming more and more, it's been 1 year and a half that I haven't gone out to do ABSOLUTELY nothing, and when I go out, I get home and take a thousand showers before doing anything, the fear of losing my family is too much. Yesterday I took my first dose of the vaccine, and don't get me wrong, I would take another 300 doses if necessary, but after taking the vaccine, I was more nervous and anxious than before, which should have been a light at the end of the tunnel, it felt more like an accessory than a real weapon to combat this whole situation. Nothing else seems to make sense, I just wish my belief in a really normal future didn't become something as distant or as romantic as it seems to be in my head.",

She got the vaccine back in May, albeit with some reluctance, but she isn't textbook \"anti-vax.\" So it's kinda beyond me why a booster shot would be any worse to her... We didn't have time to fully go into it, and all she said was \"nope, not getting it.\" So I'm going to circle back to that conversation later and hear her out. I'm just concerned for her protection, especially with the Delta variant wreaking havoc. Any tips on how I'd be able to convince her the booster shot would be beneficial?",

However, I've yet to get vaccinated because my parents are extremely anti-vax, and I'm still on their health insurance. I've been terrified of going behind their backs since I know that it will show up if the pharmacy somehow links me to the insurance (like they're supposed to). So, I was wondering if anyone knew what exactly the pharmacies use to \"look up\" your insurance. If I say I don't have any, will they still check? Is it through my address, birthday, etc? My plan right now is to go to a pharmacy, say I don't have insurance, and provide my school housing address rather than my home address where my parent's insurance is registered. Is this enough? Or do I need to lie about my birthday as well... I know this probably raises some ethical questions, but I figure getting vaccinated outweighs those. It's been too long, and I need to get it done ASAP.",

Obviously none of these are too severe, but since it's been almost 3 days and the only thing that's changed is that I can now fully lift my arm, I'm starting to get a bit worried that this might last a while. I also went for a very easy bike ride yesterday just to run some errands and get some sun, but I'd like to get back to cycling which as of now I don't feel capable of doing/ don't think it's a good idea as it might extend the duration of the symptoms. So yeah, if anyone's had similar symptoms after their first shot of <ORG>, could you please share your experience with me? Obviously, I understand that each person is different, but it's still nice to know what I can expect. TL;DR: Took first shot of <ORG> almost 3 days ago. Arm pain is mostly gone and I can fully lift it up, but still feel a bit tired and weak. Anyone had a similar experience?",

Myself, my daughter (5), son (2), and partner. Myself and my partner are both vaccinated w/ <ORG> shots. Monday August 9th - My daughter was exposed to COVID-19 Thursday August 12th - My daughter begins to experience symptoms of COVID-19. Sunday August 15th - My daughter tests positive for COVID-19. Myself and my partner test negative via a rapid antigen test. We begin our isolation. We are told Monday August 23rd we should be safe to end isolation. Tuesday August 17th - My 2 yr old son begins to show signs of fever. We do not test him. Saturday August 20st - My partner begins to experience COVID-19 symtoms. Sunday August 22nd - My partner tests positive for COVID-19 via rapid antigen test. I test negative via rapid antigen test (Today). &amp;#x200B; So tomorrow we were supposed to go off isolation. Obviously, that's not happening w/ a positive test from my partner. What should I do? Should I continue to isolate w/ my family? Should I get a hotel room? Should my partner get a hotel room and isolate from the rest of the family with my son while my daughter comes off isolation w/ me?? I don't want to abandon my family but I feel helpless. My fears are I will contract COVID in the coming days and the isolation \"timer\" will reset or worse, I will contract COVID-19 and suffer serious health issues. Any advice on what I should do and how everyone should proceed?",

My wife is an ICU nurse and has been working with Covid patients really since April 2020. She was a travel nurse when the pandemic happened, up north. My mother passed away a couple of months before Covid came to the US. She was only 57. Needless to say we have had a rush of emotions the last two years. I say all of this to say Im lost, and I feel hopeless. We are both vaccinated, and have had our scares. She got vaccinated early on in December for obvious reasons. I was lucky in the fact I worked under the department of health umbrella for the state, and got my last <ORG> shot in Feb 2021. She recently got Covid like a month ago, mild symptoms, we assume Delta. Lucky when I was tested, I surprisingly came back negative. So we are back to the norm if you will. However that lingering feeling of doom hangs over me. Im 30 years old, 60, and close to 300lbs. I know thats a risk factor, but my ice points out I have no other issues. I gained a lot of this weight in the last four years. I used to actually run half marathons and be fit. Im just still scared of getting Covid, and dying or getting long term side effects.. I do look for support from my wife, but I know she can only take so much, given her work place. I guess Im just looking for a steady view and direction, of how I should view my situation. Im scared, tired, hopeless, exhausted.",

Over the last 17 months of this pandemic Canada has been under much harsher restrictions compared to the rest of North America. Not only that but we have also had much stricter and longer lockdowns, even though our infection numbers have been lower then other places with similar restrictons. I too have recently have had a lot anxiety of another lockdown with cases going up in my province (Quebec) because I know its not going to take much for the goverment to send us back to the same place we were in the Winter (curfew included). Im terrfied of the fact of losing more of University years. My mental health tanked with online learning. It also tanked by having all my outlets taken away. Im sick of being scared of this. It sucks that I still have to be this terrfied because are vaccine numbers are good, but its clear they are not enough to go back to even some form of normal. At this point a year ago I was sure I would never fear another lockdown by this time, but I cleary was very naive. Not that you could blame me.",

All the people I once felt safe with either refuse to get vaccinated or arent being as cautious anymore. I live with my super careful brother and see my boyfriend on the weekends, but Im basically alone 90% of the time. Im always stressed about my loved ones, especially my best friend, who wont budge on getting the vaccine. Im scared Im going to lose her and anytime Ive tried to talk to her about it, she gets upset. All the hobbies I took up last year dont feel safe anymore because Im too scared to go outside. On top of COVID, Im also just dealing with a recent OCD diagnosis and lots of death/trauma/loss around me. Last year it felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel. This year it feels like we can physically see the light, but no one wants to reach it. I just feel incredibly alone and utterly hopeless. It feels like this will never end.",

After long long hours I became numb to the idea of taking <ORG> or <ORG> (since they were the only 2 ones being administered in my age group 20-29) To my surprise, I was given <PERSON>, as I heard my body became so tense that it took like 10 minutes for then to give me the damn thing.. now it's an hour later and I'm at the verge of an anxiety attack.. my chest and head hurt since I was given the vaccine.. I'm just worried for the rare severe side effects.. like GBS or Blood Clots.. even knowing how rare they are I can't help but think I'm 200% guaranteed to have one of them and be doomed..",

I have not seen my family for almost 2 years and really been wanting to visit them. But I have not because I was scared when numbers rose and on 2 occasions my travel got cancelled. Now, I am tired of waiting, being the good civilian staying home as much as possible and still following all the guidelines while all of UK is out being neglectful(imho) ,and I really want to visit them now. (I wont if things are still too crazy) So here I am looking into things, checking both the UK and Dutch gov sites. And I just can't get my head around it on my own. So here is where I ask you lot. Please help me clarify and figure out what I would need to do to safely travel, following all the guidelines. Some things to note: * I will want to travel with my SO. (I have a Dutch passport and my SO UK) * We are both fully vaccinated and working from home. * Is there a difference with traveling by airplane or by car. (I.E. Do we still need to do multiple PCR tests when traveling by car? What about isolating when we stay at my parents place) * I would like to visit between October and December. (this is just a guide date, I know things could possibly change and there is no guarantee) * It would max be a week long stay. I am just looking for help to figure out what I would need to do if I would travel both by airplane or car. From quarantining, to tests, to documentation. Preferable a clear overview or step by step kind of thing. Thanks for your help in advance.",

I don't plan on doing any major traveling again for a while and I'm happy to say I can work from home. One thing that's been getting to me deeply is going to the gym. I know people who have basically been going the whole pandemic. I was hoping to return after getting my shots. Before the pandemic, I went 3x weekly, and I loved it. I've been doing home workouts, but I find it harder to stay consistent and it's the one day-to-day activity that I really miss. Right now my area hasn't actually gotten out of its third wave and there's already news of a fourth on the way. I'm waiting to see if the case numbers drop at all before buying a membership again. I'm feeling conflicted, but my mental health has been in various states of 'bad' for this entire time and going to the gym used to be a huge help for handling depression. For people who have gone back to the gym, how do you feel about it? Do people still wear masks there (it's mandatory where I live but not enforced)? Is there anything I can do to be extra safe when I do return?",

I quarantine from the family that I do live with because they go outside, and I get severe anxiety from so much as a trip to the grocery store etc. However, I recently got into my absolute DREAM university, which under normal conditions I would be so overjoyed and excited to attend ASAP. However, things are going to be in person, and I just don't know if I can handle the sudden shift from not leaving my room (let alone my house) at all, to being in multiple classrooms full of students multiple times a week, and living in a dormroom. I know an overwhelming majority of the people at the university are vaccinated (\\~90-95%), masks are enforced, as is weekly testing. But at the same time there is a surge of delta, the rate of breakthroughs, and I was someone who got the vaccine early on - consequently I anticipate that there is a level of reduced efficacy until my 3rd booster as well. So I know there are reasons for me to go, but also legitimate reasons (including just anxiety and the effects on academic performance and wellbeing that may have in its own right) that make me hesitant. How do I weigh a decision like this? When is it genuinely just being appropriately cautions vs avoidant behavior related to me being overly anxious about Covid? Would deferral be an appropriate thing to be considering? Even if I defer theres no guarantee that things will get better? What exactly would I be waiting for if I do defer? &amp;#x200B; I would really appreciate any outside perspective and advice - just curious what others may think! Thanks a million !",

However, i am concerned it might be a rapid test and could be a false negative. i am fully vaccinated, so thats not my concern. However i do get super panicked because i live w older immunocompromised people. (fully vaccinated as of marcg) i am just looking for some advice. Should i trust him? should i isolate in my room? has anyone dealt w this? i am very nervous",

He works out at least 3-4 times a week, and eats well. Hes expecting a baby soon, actually. I love my older brother he is my rock, and has been my paternal figure for as long as I can remember. He was admitted yesterday morning because his oxygen was at 85% and he became unresponsive. The sad part is that he contracted it from his own kids &lt; age 10 (who didnt know they tested positive at the time). Now, he has developed double pneumonia. I know that his oxygen levels are in the upper nineties, but its still incredibly scary to know that it can go downhill at any moment. It hurts to see him so weak, and I feel so helpless. The stories on the news do not help, either. When I see people online say they deserve it for not being vaccinated, natural selection, etc., it just feels so dehumanizing to me. These people are human beings, with families and kids. Has anyone else had a similar experience where theyve had a (relatively young) family member in the hospital due to COVID complications?",

I live alone, work from home and only see my immediate family outdoors. This is starting to just get nightmarish for my mental health being in isolation so much. On the other hand when I get out and do things I feel better but the \"rebound\" anxiety is awful.. I just feel super stuck and like I am waking up to a nightmare that never ends. I know logically this virus will end or become endemic and life will go on but right now my optimisms is running low and my mental health is at its breaking point. I also have terrible health anxiety, so my mind automatically assumes if I get it, it will be a death sentence. Please any support right now would be great. If you are going to belittle me or tell me I'm being irrational... please don't comment and move on. I really don't need that right now.",

I got my first <ORG> shot and cant begin to describe the freedom and relief its given me so far :) The thing is, most people here disagree with me and some of the things people are saying are disturbing, and have caused me great sadness and anxiety. The most difficult thing to hear from antivaxxers and COVID deniers is to let it take its course, the strong will survive, and to let it depopulate a crowded planet. Im studying farming and human health is deeply interwoven in agriculture. Im well aware of the dangers of overpopulation, especially what this will mean for future generations, but still want to protect to protect my fellow people. I think about the millions who have died, young and old, healthy and at risk, and it breaks my heart. Im the only one isolating in my farm program (until my 2nd shot), delta has made it here to this small unvaccinated town, and dont have anyone to talk to about my fears. My co-workers aunt died of COVID, yet he is still antivaxx and blames it on her being overweight and weak. Its just a cold he says, the strong will survive, youre tough right? I have a compromised lung and am terrified of what it might do to me. To hear let the strong live from such a tight knit hippie community just doesnt make any sense. I feel so alone you guys, and cant wrap my head around my peers being okay with the weak dying off. Please help me regain my faith back in humanity. Sending love to you all &lt;3",

Because I was not showing any symptoms, and because I am double vaccinated (<ORG>, 6 months ago), the P.A. recommended I take a PCR test. The PCR test came back negative this morning. Yesterday, the P.A. said I could avoid quarantining and resume my life as normal if the PCR came back negative. I am tired from traveling and jet lag but otherwise have still yet to experience any symptoms. In fact, I just got back from running 5k and feel fine. Other than the run, I have not left my house. Which test should I believe? Should I quarantine despite the negative PCR? Is it safe/responsible towards my community members if I go about my life as usual?",

For context, my university has a vaccine mandate where ~99% are vaccinated, and a mask requirement. Now some students are calling for mandatory testing as well. They want transparency regarding the covid situation at my school. However, a point Ive often heard is that the vaccine does not prevent infection. It does, however, work to keep you from getting sick, so cases may not be the best metric post-vaccination. Now this may be different for places with low vaccine uptake, but my state has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. Yet, these students defend their arguments by saying they dont want to spread it to their family, and even with a vaccine, if you could avoid the virus by staying home, then why not stay home. With all this in mind, Im afraid that if we get mandatory testing, people will freak out by seeing a high raw case number (and forget that the point of the vaccine is not to prevent infection), and go remote. I guess they do have a point to some extent. Given the situation of covid rn with the Delta variant, and hospitals in some states overwhelmed, theres still a need for vigilance. But I just feel like theyre completely overlooking the point of the vaccine here, and acting like its March 2020 again. I know that youre largely safe post-vaccination, and you always have to accept a certain level of risk in your life, and even with Delta, the vaccinated are still largely protected. Maybe theyre just a vocal minority, but Im afraid the administration takes their word and puts all of us back online. I just want to add - I know this post could make me come off as anti-restrictions at first, but Ive been following the restrictions since the virus hit and got the vaccine at the earliest opportunity, and Im 100% supportive of vaccine mandates to get us back to normal. But its just getting to me how these people are acting like its March 2020 all over again. Granted Reddit is often not reflective of the average persons opinion, but if you guys have any support, Id love to hear it",

And I really regret moving out of my parents home and moving too a different city in the sf bay area. I was hoping that this summer we would be able too say goodbye too masks and that I wouldn't have too worry about getting judged for going too large social gatherings like concerts. But that never happened and a good amount of people I meet disagree with my decision too go too concerts right now. I just feel so hopeless living in the sf bay area and I won't have enough money too leave the sf bay area anytime soon :(",

I prefer that he have a long healthy life. 3. He is 2, so he cannot get vaccinated. 4. He will be getting vaccinated as soon as he turns 12 OR the vaccine becomes available to his age group. &amp;#x200B; Tomorrow daycare will be returning to full operation after being cleaned for the last 2 weeks. Nothing will be changed. Their lax mask policy stands as is, and will not be altered in any way. I want to make sure that I am doing everything I can for the health and safety of my son.

I am just shocked and stunned at this level of idiocy. So many kids are being left without parents. People encourage their adult children or their parents to not vaccinate and then they watch them die, followed soon by their own deaths. Some families have lost multiple members. Not to mention the data coming out of hospitals. I just read that only about 1400 vaccinated people in the US have died of covid compared to 180,000 unvaxxed (since the vax became available).

Most of the time, these comments are saying there are people at risk to be protected, the hospitals and that's why certain behavior is or certain wants are selfish, antisocial,... without mentioning what is still seen as our way out: vaccination. The way I see it is that there's a way out, a societal goal to be achieved but since many people who could really need the vaccine are refusing to take it, we still are asked/made... to take precautions. Why won't some people tell the whole story? Too low vaccination rates are our problem that is holding us back from returning to normality! I wish people would extend their narrative by this one point.",

It sort of worked out okay, because he had an office job that he went to 5 days a week so I had at least some space when I wasn't in class or working. Then covid hit, and he had to work from home indefinitely. Even after the vaccines. He literally does not go anywhere, he has no social life, so he was pretty much home 24/7 and I we would start butting heads more. He kept assuring me he'd go back eventually though. But a few months ago, he was laid off because the pandemic hit the company hard and they had to make a cut; they decided the cut was going to be him. So now there's no end in sight. I feel I have very little personal space and it's driving me insane. It's all the typical issues one may have when living with their parents as an adult, except the parent in question literally never leaves the house. Ever. On top of that, I've become the sole provider without warning, and I'm a part timer college student making MAYBE $1000 a month if I'm really lucky. I was planning on moving out with a couple friends, but I'm afraid of the guilt accompanying that now. My dad has tried and failed to reach an actual human being about getting his unemployment for months now- it's been an endless cycle of of applying &gt; not hearing anything &gt; checking status &gt; case has expired for some reason &gt; try to contact &gt; nobody is ever available &gt; try applying again. I've been trying to get back to the things I missed out on last year to cheer myself up, but it's really hard. Even if this all finally passes, that does nothing to help the financial and emotional situation. I tried looking into therapy, but surprise surprise, I can't afford it even with insurance.",

So, they really wanted me to join a bowling league since I used to be in one with them a few years ago and I live in town with my grandparents (vaxxed) again. I reluctantly agreed, though didnt really want to because I still felt uncomfortable. But, with covid low at the time, I figured Id at least try to rejoin society. Then, delta hit, and has been ravaging my state pretty bad since it is a deeply antivax state. Since then, Ive been trying to act like everything is close to normal (though Ive been wearing my mask), and I even went to the first week of bowling. My grandparents are currently in the middle of a covid scare, though it looks like were all negative with some random bug. With me possibly getting an in person job, knowing Im a bit of a hypochondriac, and with me living with my grandparents, I dont really want to continue going to bowling with everyone else, but rather just by myself. The other members of the league are audibly anti-mask (I was the only one wearing a mask when I went), and its not a position I really want to put myself in at this point in time. I just know that my family is going to be really mad at me for wanting to bowl by myself and I feel kinda bad for backing out.",

He's been in quarantine for 13 days now since he first had symptoms. On the 2nd day after he tested positive, he got a monoclonal antibody infusion after which he had a high fever (39.5 C) for a day. His immune system is not very good and he has diabetes in case this is relevant. So he hasn't had a fever since then (under 37 C). He still has no appetite, coughs sometimes and is tired often. He took another test and still tested positive. CDC site says people with compromised immune systems may be infectious up to 20 days. Our city's tracing corps called and said after 10 days he can stop quarantine. But we are worried he can still be infectious. My question is, is there any test that he can take that can tell if he is still infectious and what does the science say about testing positive after a 14 day quarantine. How long could he be infectious? Thank you.",

My future FIL is immunocompromised from an autoimmune disease. When the vaccines came out, it seemed like that would have been the end of it. They suggested they were looking forward to coming after they got vaccinated. Then obviously the Delta spike happened. Well, I was completely expecting them to cancel before our RSVP date, which was 2 weeks ago. But they communicated to us that they were coming and were even offering to set up a rehearsal dinner for us. Well, today, they tell us they are still too scared, despite booster shots being available and covid cases trending down in most parts of the US. I am currently crying at work. My MIL/FIL and I had a wonderful relationship before all of this, but now I feel like I have to hide my true feelings. I am really upset. I know we all have our own thresholds for risk, but it is INFURIATING when we have data supporting returning back to pre-pandemic activities and vaccines and booster shots, and they are still scared? Why? I will admit, they expressed concerns about delta. But why not commit to saying no 2 months ago? Why wait til the last minute? It makes me feel like they will be absent in our lives for years to come because we moved out of state 2 years ago and it honestly feels like they are waiting for zero covid. Am I being a brideZilla here? How do I not hold a grudge against them for this? And lastly, is there any current evidence or metrics for immunocompromised folk that they should be following? Any advice would be helpful. DISCLAIMER: if you look at my post history, you will see I have health anxiety and generalized anxiety. I do not take meds for it. I have seen therapists in the past. My anxiety is mostly triggered by life events.",

I went in there with her in the stroller and was petrified because it's indoors and yes there are masks but no one enforces this apparently. I was afraid of exposing her. She doesn't have the option of being masked or vaxxed. This little girl without a mask comes running over and the mom runs over and grabs her. I tell my fiance about it and she hears me. Basically, she refused to tell her child to put her mask on and wore her own below her nose. I told her that she isn't telling her child to put her mask on and she's not wearing hers right. I asked where is the compassion because my little one can't wear a mask or get vaxxed? Nothing. She ignored me. There was a three hour wait to be seen and we ended up leaving after this. Where's the compassion? I lost my grandfather to COVID while pregnant. I've watched my mother suffer now with not feeling safe outside, etc. I ended up bawling in the car. I just don't want to lose her and I know I won't but I can't help but feel so extremely protective of her. I gave birth in the epicenter. New Yorker here. I'm getting a booster on Monday. I'm a first time mom this is all very new to me and I'm trying. I don't know what else to say. I just don't know why it's so hard to be considerate.",

Its usually not an issue because our friends and family are all vaccinated and we havent been exposed. But Im having trouble deciding what to do after a recent exposure. I was vaccinated in April and havent gotten my booster yet (Im supposed to get it next Tuesday). I dont have symptoms. Heres the events: On Monday my aunt had a party and I attended. On Tuesday I went to work on my scheduled in-person day. On Wednesday my aunt tested positive for COVID and I was informed that afternoon. I informed my workplace and anybody Id been in contact with about the exposure. On Thursday (today) work sent me to get a rapid test and PCR test done. Rapid test was negative, results from the PCR are supposed to come back Saturday. I updated work et al. Our weekend plans were to see friends Friday through Saturday (sleepover, annual Christmas white elephant party) and to see family on Sunday (their first time seeing our new house and local famous Christmas lights). Weve told the friend hosts and the family that planned to visit that I was exposed and rapid tested negative. The friends said whatever youre comfortable with, the family with young kids is staying home, and the family without kids is going to decide based on PCR. Im mostly worried about spreading it by having gotten tested too early and getting a false negative rapid test. The CDC says get tested 5-7 days after exposure, but the doctor said I was ok to be tested when I did, and dont have to test again unless I develop symptoms. Im thinking that instead of spending the night at our friends, we only go for the party Saturday, stay masked the whole time, and keep an eye out for the PCR results that should come that day. We are going to let our family know about the PCR results and leave the Sunday plans up to their decision. What do you think?",

This past fall my mental health has gotten a little better but now that I just got back from college this morning I already hate being back home. My dad keeps talking about how things will only get worse. Omicron is way more deadly and contagious than Delta and how if we dont isolate ourselves were gonna die. My family is fully vaccinated and my parents have also gotten a booster and I had Covid a month ago. I cant keep living like this. Ive been in isolation since I was 19. Im now 21 and Im so lonely and miserable and I have nothing to look forward to. I keep myself busy with art and I collect and read comic books but I still feel so empty and trapped. I sometimes wish Covid was deadlier so we can all die now and get it over with. I think being in isolation has given me CPTSD and I have very bad mood swings. I also have panic attacks every time my dad talks about how things will only get worse or that I have to learn to live like this. I cant see a therapist because my dad says mental health is the biggest lie doctors have ever told us and that I should ignore my feelings like people used to do in the old days. I just cant take this anymore. Ive posted here before many times and every times I do everyone tells me to move out which is not an option because I dont have money and I cant get money cuz Im not allowed to have a job because for Covid",

That literally sounds like hell to me. Everything in my area seems to be going well beause most people are vaccinated, schools report whenever someone is sick and encourage people to stay home if they are, and people wear masks inside. I am honestly terrified that everything will shut down again, and I don't know what I will do if it does.

Chise (the moderna scientist on twitter) is maintaining that the omicron variant is not that bad for those who are not immune-naive (meaning they got infected or they've been fully vaccinated and boosted) and even showing that the omicron variant in particular replicates more in the throat than in the lungs, which is a very good sign that covid pneumonia might not be that common with Omicron. However all the media seems to be talking about today is how this new variant is the worst thing to ever happen and that we have no protection because vaccinated people are testing positive (despite many I've heard of having very mild to no symptoms) and how we need to shut down everything again. I ended up getting banned from the main coronavirus sub because I didn't agree with the doom and gloom narrative that's being pushed by the news today and I'm honestly really upset and angry about it. All the data coming out of South Africa is pointing twoards Omicron not being a major problem for people who are not immune naive but I'm constantly being gaslit by everybody....",

I feel like if the full lockdown in the UK happens again, it's pretty much a guaranteed sign that this is how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives: 8 months of freedom, 4 months of lockdowns every year. If the coming January-February is gonna be the same as the previous one even with the vaccines and new treatments, what's the guarantee that January 2023, 2024 or 2030 won't be the same? If we have a mutation that can avoid immunity from vaccines that initially had 95% effectiveness, what can be the rational reason to believe that we won't have a mutation that can completely avoid the first, second or third booster? People are saying that this pandemic will certainly end and covid will just become like cold/flu, but I feel like this virus has completely binned every normal epidemiological rule we knew. Most of those \"other\" pandemics we talk about were usually over or coming to a close by the two-year mark, and even if they weren't they at least weren't getting worse by that point due to increased immunity. Those other viruses weren't approaching the R rate similar to that of measles. What's the rational justification for the belief that this won't just continue indefinitely? I feel like at this point it'd just be easier for me to give up and finally accept that this is how life's gonna be. I know I will certainly never be fully happy with this, but maybe next generations will manage to mentally adapt to it, just like humans adapted to everything else. Can someone give me any rational assurance that it is still possible to ever come back to normal?",

We were super close before the pandemic, we used to hang out every weekend, she helped me realize I was transgender. And then when the pandemic happened it tore my old friend group apart. They are only 2 that I can somewhat regularly see now. And with one of them we've frequently gotten into disagreements over what is safe post vaccine. And now we can't see each other very often because a) she's really busy with other things now, and b) she thinks my decision to go to concerts and Florida last month was really stupid. So far I've tried going to meetup groups, online dating, and even zoom groups. And so far I haven't found anyone that I really feel like I connect super well with and I can do things like travel with. I did find some people for edc Orlando that I connected with super well, but they all live very far away from me. Overall I feel like if I died that people wouldn't really miss me given that I can't find new friends that I can connect with super well post vaccine. And omicron is gonna make it way harder to connect with people and go to social gatherings. Ive also tried finding mental health support groups in person and I've had 0 luck because there's none in my area. They are some in Florida, but Florida is very far away from me. I'm only going to be able to afford to go once next year. I'm also concerned that my area could have more lockdowns eventually, omicron is hitting even well vaccinated areas like NYC pretty hard",

Like cancel Broadway musicals, no live audience for SNL tonight, and etc. I hope theyre not going to shut down Disneyland again, because when they were closed, I thought theyre going to be closed forever, but thankfully it didnt. Also, whats taking those slow scientists so long to find data about the Omicron? We have to end this pandemic next year. Sure the Pandemic will end, but with the news being irresponsible and cases rising, how are we going to end this pandemic if those stupid unprofessional scientists dont admit that the Omicron is good news or another way to stop it?

She told me that I could bring it in another day and get it filled out because my dose information would be in their system. Perfect, so I get the shot and go home. Three days later I come back to a CVS, and I'm asking a (different) pharmacist to fill out my card with the information in the system. He tells me there is no documentation of my second dose at all. He tells me to check with the state department and I do: they tell me the same thing. So apparently there is no information about my second vaccine dose, which has been pretty troubling considering you need the vaccine card to get into a lot of places now. In fact, this caused an extended crisis with my university where I was nearly removed from courses until I explained my situation to quite a few different people in higher positions. Obviously I'm tired of this whole thing. I was wondering if it would be a bad idea for me to just go on ahead and get two full rounds of the <ORG> vaccine (in other words, just restart my vaccination process altogether). I know folks overseas who first got the Sinopharm vaccine before it was approved by the FDA, and had to get <ORG> when travelling to the States. Could this kind of thing have any health implications? Can you recommend it (or discourage it) to the best of your knowledge? I'm just kinda tired of being in this limbo status.",

He has been an essential worker throughout this whole pandemic as he works for hospitals, government buildings, schools, nursing homes, you name it and he's been in it. He probably goes to 5 to 10 places a day depending. We have managed to dodge COVID this entire time. He always wears a mask and he is vaccinated (2x <ORG> with last dose being in May) but hadn't gotten boosted yet. :/ Today he got a call to go to our local jail, only to have the guy who let him in tell him he picked a bad day to come (the jail called in for support though...) because they had 40 POSITIVE CASES. My husband called his boss who told him to suck it up and if he was wearing a mask he'd be fine. My husband never came close to any of the inmates as he was in a back room the whole time, wore his KN95 mask, and was there for less than 30 mins but we are both freaking out. Why the fuck did they not tell him before he went in???? And right before Christmas too. Just great. When should he get tested? The options around here are already so limited because of cases blowing up. I'm so upset and scared. I'm immunocompromised but triple vaxxed... still. I hate this, I'm so tired of this all.",

Yes, extracurricular clubs occur, but we don't have assemblies or anything like that. I was in Grade 9 during the 2019-2020 school year. Life was going good. Then March 2020 hit, and I got sent to online learning. Then for the entirety of the 2020-2021 school year I was online. Now, finally I got to go back to in-person in 2021-2022, but with masking and distancing and stuff like that. I know it's not big of a deal, but I wanted to have the entire, normal high school experience. When the vaccines came out I thought things would finally get better, my school was actually talking about holding in-person assemblies/mass gatherings in 2022. Then Omicron came :( If this ends at the end of 2022 then half of my grade 12 will be finished. That means my \"normal\" high school would have only been the first half of grade 9 and the last half of grade 12,.. I know it sounds stupid, but I really wanted to experience high school, ah well, hopefully my university will be normal. :(",

They have tested positive and have since started quarantining in their own room. Ive been staying at a friends place prior to said sibling returning home. Thankfully, Im on a break from school right now and wont have work again until next week. My parents for some reason want me also to come home, but Im feeling unsure of it because my sibling and parents have been interacting before knowledge of the positive COVID result. Were all vaccinated and my parents are planning to get tested in the next couple of days. Based on this info, do you guys think its alright for me to go back? Or at least to pick up work clothes for the following week Im concerned about bringing COVID to my coworkers/friends/others who I might be in contact with.",

I mean, remember we thought that this year in 2021, we thought it'll finally be the end of the pandemic since we've got the vaccines. Sadly, the pandemic didn't end this year and I was very disappointed about that. Sure, it's better than last year, but not the greatest recovery we ever had. Of course, we almost end the pandemic last summer until the Delta and Omicron came to stop it. I was hoping that 2022 may be the end of the pandemic and returning to normal, but with the Omicron (even though it's mild) going on, I'm not sure it'll end that quickly. As for the vaccines, I've just found out that our vaccination rate in the U.S. is 61% for fully vaccinated. Which is not bad, but it would've been higher. I've heard that we won't be back to normal until we reach either 80% or 90% vaccination rate, which I'm afraid it's going to be a long time, So I'm not sure it'll end next year. But, despite of pessimistic behavior, I'm hoping that I'm wrong and I wanted to be proved wrong. I'm still hoping it'll end next year, but for now, I'm not sure.",

Theyre ok with me visiting, but I dont know how long their protection will even last. Ive started just wearing a surgical mask when I work out, but I hate it, and I dont even know if thats enough to protect me when no one around me is wearing masks. Idk. Im so conflicted.

They prescribed me a Z pack and sent me on my way, I just saw my primary care Dr today and he told me he thinks I will be fine by next week. It's already been 5 days I can not hear out of my left ear and I'm scared as hell. He said my eardrum may become perforated and that's normal? He also said it could take up to 3 months to regain my hearing completely which is really worrisome to me. Did anyone else go through this and how long did it take for your hearing to come back.

I am wondering how long to wait until taking a rapid test I bought last night. It's a hard decision to make because of Christmas plans I had with my girlfriend &amp; loved ones this weekend. It's hard to say if I am either completely fine and protected due to mask + triple vax, or if there is a strong possibility I could catch it, even if the symptoms are mild or not present. Would tomorrow night (about 55-60 hrs after exposure) be too soon for a rapid test? Thanks",

I dont try new foods, medicines, anything because of the fear of having an allergic reaction. I know its rare, but I have other bad allergies to things. Ive also had thyroid cancer at age 16 which I is a rare thing, so if not cancer at 16 then why not a severe allergy to the vaccine? Anyone else have this fear? Were you able to overcome it? Im leaning towards the pfizer or moderna as the J&amp;J has a risk of Guillan-Barre syndrome which absolutely horrifies me",

        "Reddit Post": "Hi all, Im sort of confused as to what counts as exposure to Covid and what precautions should be taken in this specific situation. Its important to know that my parents have two separate places of residence. While I was away at college, my brother started feeling ill and went to go isolate at my moms place. Two days later, I came home from college (staying at my dads place) and my brother tested positive. I wiped down a lot of the commonly used surfaces just in case some viral particles were still there, but at this point, it had been two days since my positive brother was in the house. Five days into his isolation, he decided he wanted to finish it out at my dads place, where I had been staying for the past couple of days. We are physically isolated, as he has a room and bathroom to himself, and whenever I am outside of my room, I wear a mask around the house. Technically, I have not been in any contact with him and have been washing my hands a lot, especially after touching common surfaces, but do exposure rules change now that we are in the same house? Should I be acting like I have been exposed? For further context, I am fully vaccinated and got the booster around a month ago and Im not experiencing any symptoms.",

Currently he's feeling better and doesn't have symptoms, and he wants to come to our New Years Eve party because by then it will be 9-10 days since symptoms first began. I feel like that's cutting it a bit too close since everyone will be unmasked at this party. He's vaccinated but I wanted to get everyone's opinion on if it's too soon for him to attend or if we're being overly paranoid? Thanks",

I guess the best solution for now and for real this time is take a sabbatical leave of absence. I guess I need to take a break from this for awhile before I lose hope again. I guess I'll come back either next month or February with hope the Omicron peaks next month, if it ever happens. I'm sorry I give you guys false hopes.

My mental health has been deteriorating recently with the surge in cases and the vaccination status of my parents. I love them, but they have been making questionable choices throughout this pandemic. They were great when the pandemic started, being supportive and taking precautions, but ever since the vaccine came out they've turned full on anti-vax and are now spouting nonsense about how covid is a hoax. They refuse to get vaccinated and are even planning on flying to Florida in late January for a vacation. I've tried to be understanding and voiced my concerns, never trying to force anything, but no matter what it seems like I'll have to accept that they continue to believe what they believe. Most recently I cancelled my Christmas plans with them due to a covid exposure I got and it's been nothing but guilt tripping from them trying to tell me how I'm overreacting and that we should be spending the holidays together. I've accepted that I can't change their mind and can't control their lifestyle, but my mental health has taken a plunge due to my worry for them cause at the end of the day I do love them. Has anyone in a similar situation found a good way to deal with the anxiety and stress? I'm trying to distract myself with hobbies and my puppy but it's just so hard these days.",

I have an immune disorder but I was more afraid of giving them Covid because of the worse outcomes for unvaxxed that I tested myself beforehand to make sure I was negative. I had been just ignoring their medical stupidity and political opinions for the past 2 years, justifying it as they are family and I cant control them and their decisions. Of course, on the 28th my stepmom and my BIL (who is vaxxed &amp; boosted) both tested positive - unclear when their symptoms started. I tested PCR positive on the 31st (after 2 negative home tests). My dad refused to quarantine and doesnt wear a mask at work (hes in customer service). I cant say with 100% certainty that they gave it to me but its more likely than not one of them did. Even if they didnt, I think Im more upset that my dad didnt quarantine. He sent me a long-winded text about how hes disappointed in me for choosing the path Im on (Im a PhD student, so that stings) and how we are, and I quote, diametrically opposed politically and in social values. I dont want to discuss politics here, but I need support in knowing how to respond. We obviously have different values and I dont know what that means for a parent/child relationship as adults. I have children so I hate the thought of separating them from their grandparents, but I also feel like they brought this on themselves by not getting vaccinated - and moreover, not caring about spreading it to others. Its one thing to risk your own life, its another to risk others. I am hoping that my symptoms stay relatively mild, given my immune disorder, but I regret risking my health to see them when they dont even care to do the bare minimum. Any advice? :(",

As a result, I have over time lost all other relationships with family and friends. Now, with the virus being utterly unavoidable, they will die and I will be left alone.

I have the usual symptoms such as headache and loss of taste and smell, but Ive also been experiencing some not so common symptoms as well and would like some feedback to see if there are others who have experienced it as well. These past few days when I started losing my sense of smell, I noticed a tingling sensation that started in my nose and extended throughout my face little by little. I believe Im on day 6 today, and today I noticed that the tingling sensation has evolved into a sharper pain. I feel it all around my jaw and on my chin, its to the point where my jaw feels like it stiffens up or it locks up all of a sudden. Has anyone else experienced this? I was thinking this may be related to the fact that I had a chin lipo a year ago. The sharp pain on my chin centers right where the cannula was inserted and I figured this might have to do with some sort of microvascular issue in relation to COVID, since I just started experiencing this a few days ago.",

On Monday I was feeling completely fine, but then on Tuesday I woke up with a scratchy throat, nasal congestion, fatigue, but I figured since my body doesnt do well with weather changes, I figured I was having a reaction from the cool dry air. Then yesterday I started to feel even worse, having the chills and nausea on top of the other symptoms, and now Ive just thrown up. It could be possible because my mom is a preschool teacher and one of the classrooms next to her shut down because like half the kids and the teachers were positive, so the rest of the kids from that classroom are now in her room. She told me on Monday evening. Covid tests are very difficult to go do in my area right now because of the surge. Although I would like to test, it has been extremely difficult to do so. Would it be safe to assume I likely have covid since a lot of my symptoms line up with omicron? It hasnt been particularly unbearable (Ive been double vaxxed and boosted since November).",

We did not have any contact with my brother or SIL during these two weeks. Friday (New Year's Eve): My brother and his wife went out for New Year's Eve, and this is likely where they got covid (although they are not careful at all so it could have been before or after this, who knows) Sunday: My parents briefly met up with my brother in a parking lot to give him his kids back. My mom was masked and seated inside the car while my brother (NOT masked) had his head inside while he got the kids' car seats out. But she says there were 2-3 car doors open while this happened (i.e ventilation). My dad was masked and standing outside the whole time. The whole exchange was about 5-10 minutes and it was a windy day. Then my parents drove 3 hours back home, unmasked in the car. Monday: My brother's wife developed symptoms, she later tested positive Thursday: My brother developed symptoms (unsure if he had them earlier or if this was the first day) So my parents are isolating in their room just in case they have it and will get tested tomorrow on day 5. Although I think I would have already got it from them by now. I think the odds are really really slim. What do you think? Should we get tested? Isolate?

However, my nose hurts and burns and my teeth hurt SO BAD. I took a rapid test a few times last week and all negative. I had a PCR done yesterday around 3pm and came back negative this morning. Ngl, I kept telling myself it was all in my head and Id feel better once I saw that negative, but I havent improved. Teeth pain so bad I could cry, congestion, and fatigue that wasnt there before. Is this just a bad cold? Should I bother taking another rapid and/or PCR? Sorry, I dont have an an exact exposure timeline and dont understand when my bio load/viral load is highest. Thank you.",

January 3rd--mild sore throat, January 4th and 5th--painful sore throat, headache and a low grade fever. My fever lasted three days and mainly stayed around 99 to 99.5 degrees. Since January 6th, my fever went away and my throat feels better. It is now day 8 and I felt that most of my symptoms had gone away, but today I struggled with migraines and stomach issues. I have not had a cough or a runny nose. I still have my sense of taste and smell. The worst lingering symptoms are headache and fatigue. But anxiety makes me feel like I am dying sometimes even when I objectively seem okay. At this point am I likely to keep getting better? Do I still need to keep an eye out for shortness of breath? Im so scared that even though it seems like Im getting better, things will suddenly worsen.",

        "Reddit Post": "40 years old asthmatic (well-controlled) with severe health anxiety. I have had many ups and downs over the pandemic. Managing my health anxiety has been a struggle, but I managed. It helped that I'm in a position where I can pretty much isolate myself if needed. I often resorted to that in times of high transmission rates. It always felt like there was at least some chance of avoiding Covid. But now? Like this quote from a [BBC article]([url] \"Today the Omicron variant represents a new west-to-east tidal wave, sweeping across the region on top of the Delta surge that all countries were managing until late 2021,\" Dr Kluge told a news conference. He quoted the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as forecasting that \"more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks\". Stuff like that just leaves me at a complete loss on what to do now. I'm incredibly afraid of getting Covid, mainly because I have rotten luck when it comes to health stuff. I'm convinced that it will make me very unwell. The common vibe in my country and pretty much everywhere is: \"Eh, everyone will get it, so \" And I just don't know where this leaves people who are at risk. I'm trying not to obsess over it and try to distract myself as much as possible. But really, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop and it sucks so much. I live in a country where the government has pretty much given up and everyone just wants to get this over with. But at what cost? Even if I might be fine, I have immunocompromised loved ones and I don't know if they'll survive this. I'm beyond frustrated and sad and this whole 'let's end the pandemic with a BANG' mood I'm seeing everywhere feels dreadful.",

Turns out that on Sunday she saw a family friend who is now very sick with a high fever, cough, the whole deal. My partner tested negative on a rapid test yesterday before coming over, but Im not confident thats an accurate result based on the timeline. My question is this: is there any sense in having my partner isolate in a bedroom here at my house given that yesterday we were kissing, had sex, etc.? Like, wouldnt I already be exposed and thus have no reason to isolate? Or is it still sensible to have her isolate on the chance that I somehow havent already gotten it?

After my booster yesterday, I started feeling unwell much more quickly, within half an hour, and went to bed. I woke up around 6am, the side effects were pretty intense. I felt so cold, yet clammy and hot too, the room was spinning and I felt very nauseous at times that I couldn't move. Sore throat with taste/smell are diminished (I tried a fruity antacid because my mouth felt strange). At times I felt short of breath, fortunately I have a pulse oximeter: 95% oxygen saturation at 100 BPM (at rest). I took Tylenol and Gravol and slept until 1:30pm. As the day has gone on, I am now feeling a bit better. The oximeter is now showing 97% at 76 BPM, seems more normal for being in bed. Of course now I'm not tired! The vaccine information slip they gave me, described \"mild\" side effects. I would not call my experience mild! I was sick in December with maybe-covid so I'm wondering if that has anything to do with my body's unhappy reaction today. I hope that whenever the next booster is, that it isn't any more intense than this. :/ Anyway, I'm very pleased to have got the vaccine, eventually I wabt to see my parents (been 2 years!).

Well when I saw it my opinion was a bit different. He is saying the world needs to be vaxxed. I agree with that. However, whether another variant comes or not depends on what happens. Also his talk of Omnicron is more nuanced: he says it is foolish to let people just try to take their chances with this particularly unvaccinated ones. But that does not mean vaccinations are ineffective. Still are. He still thinks the pandemic can end this year provided we vaccinate more in the world. That I agree with.

My husband has asthma, some degree of fatty liver and gets every upper respiratory virus. He has had to go to the ER for a breathing treatment with flu before. He had J &amp; J last March and <ORG> booster at the end of October. Ive just read so many anecdotal reports of clots; etc. even in vaxxed. In our best hospital 30% of admits are vaxxed and almost that high in ICU. I dont see how Omicron is milder. Im just so stressed and anxious.",

It started with my heart pounding in my chest and feeling anxious but has morphed into high blood pressure and the symptoms I mentioned above. I was traveling with my finac and started having severe chest pain and shortness of breathing and headed to the ER. I arrived with a blood pressure of 160/100, but all the labs and tests came back normal. They chalked it up to either long covid or that I had covid again, but wouldn't test me again since I had it so soon. When we got back home I went to my primary care doctor as advised by the ER and they did another EKG that came back like a heart attack, but it was a false positive and scheduled me for an echocardiogram... I feel like the symptoms are serious, but I also feel like it could just be anxiety, but none of my doctors have suggested that or have even mentioned how we can treat it? It has been frustrating to have no answers or course of action. Symptoms Still: No appieate Heart-Pounding/Palapations Medium-High Blood Pressure Weird Chest Pain",

My SO got covid around 14 days ago (at least that's when symptoms first showed) and although all of the major symptoms are gone and a negative antigen test a few days ago; there is still an occasional cough every now and then. I have read from other user's posts and from friends that this is pretty consistent with people who had covid. I have since been quarantining from her, but I am curious if this cough could mean she is contagious still. I do realize it has been much longer than the CDC's guidelines in regards to both 5 and even 10 days, and I was wondering if I am just being overly cautious and that we are actually in the clear to see each other, kiss, etc. ;essentially carry on as normal.

I'm vaxxed, boosted, etc. However: Boy, do I need a hug. I haven't touched another human in 2 years. I moved to a new city at the start of the pandemic, which turned out to be the worst time possible. With everything being closed most of the time, I haven't been able to build any kind of social life here. I miss physical closeness so much. With social distancing still being strongly encouraged and sometimes mandated where I live, how will I experience hugs? I've read the advice to get a pet, or get a weighted blanket, etc. Well, pets aren't allowed in my apartment, and I do have thick blankets which are very comfy, but... they're in no way are a substitute for real human touch. Also, while I understand masking has been necessary to combat the spread of covid, it has had a profound psychological impact on me. I guess because all you see is people's eyes. You don't see their mouths when they talk, you just hear voices. You don't see facial expressions, you don't see smiles. Everybody's face is hidden behind a mask, like they're a potential threat. It makes going out into the world, into the city, such an impersonal, closed off experience, at least it does to me. Like it's even harder to connect with other people. Maybe I'm weird. &amp;#x200B; Maybe this is more of a rant than anything. It's just that covid restrictions, social distancing, mask mandates, can't go away soon enough. I wish to be able to truly connect and be close with other people irl again.",

Eating simple foods and staying hydrated. Taste/smell are mostly offline. Very achy. Is this taking too long for a vaccinated person? How do I know when to call my doctor about it? Should I assume Im contagious until all symptoms resolve? Isolating away from home because theres only one bathroom there, so its not ideal.",

For various reasons, I rarely visit the doctors, even when I'm injured. It's irresponsible, I know, and I'm not looking for criticism towards that specifically. Regardless, I had frequent irregular heart rhythms (and shortness of breath) for more than a week after each time I was vaccinated, which made my job extremely hard. Worse for me is that I am extremely physically active, my job is physically active, I am a healthy weight, I have never drunk alcohol, taken drugs, smoked, or consumed any other harmful substance, so a profound feeling of impending doom loomed over me during those times. And no, I didn't go to the doctor, and I will defer to the doctor for advice on whether I should continue to get these vaccinations as a last resort. I don't watch or read news, nor do I have have a phone or a TV. I'm not on any social media excluding reddit, and rarely comment here. I find myself easily overwhelmed by information, so I've chosen to avoid all of it that doesn't come through my mailbox. It's hard for me to get doctors appointments in recent years, especially since my local surgery moved to mobile apps to make appointments. All of my interactions are professional, otherwise I'm completely alone, I have no friends and have no support structure or contact with family. Please advise, I'm afraid. Should I get the booster, knowing that I experienced these symptoms? Has anyone received any advice with these symptoms post-vaccination? Note: Throwaway because my employer knows my main.",

If the potential long term effects of COVID were things like joint pains, lung damage, and altered taste, and nothing else, I might be able to live with that. But the idea of me one day never being able to focus or remember things properly to the point where I'll never be able to find work or even do simple things like driving (which I love to do by the way) or even take a shower without feeling like I'll pass out for three days afterwards, is absolutely ***terrifying.*** But the worst part? The initial onset of symptoms doesn't seem to matter for your chances of getting neurological Long COVID. There have been reports of people with asymptomatic cases developing the condition. Scientists can't even seem to come to an agreement on how common Long COVID is, even though they've been monitoring this disease for two god damn years. I've seen reports of it ranging from 10% to 30% of all cases, and almost none of them give out data of how common it is for vaccinated patients. Even Chise, someone on Twitter that I've always looked to for reassurance, didn't do much when she posted data of how common Long COVID is for vaccinated patients, simply because it contradicts everything else that I had seen to this point, and my brain just doesn't know what to trust more. From what I've read, I'm at risk for neurological Long COVID. I may not have anything serious like Schizophrenia or Bi-Polar Personality Disorder, but my brain is still a hot mess of Pure-O, Anxiety, and possibly Autism and ADHD, almost all of which puts me at a higher risk. So...hooray me. The media seems to be putting more focus on Long COVID since Omicron's fatality rate seems to have gone down the toilet, which is only exacerbating my anxieties about it more. I hate this so much. Why couldn't this virus just been another respiratory infection and nothing else?",

I feel mostly scared that we will make the same mistake and something much deadlier will surface, especially since we typically have long winters where I live. I hope this doesn't come off as me being a doomer and saying I want us to wear masks for the rest of our lives. I want this pandemic to be behind us as much as everyone else since there are activates I would like to do in late spring. I just think it's far to soon to declare the pandemic as getting better and do away with precautions while numbers are still high.",

However, my past few visits to Twitter have had a severe impact on my mental health. Eight times out of ten, whenever I search Twitter for Covid news, I get bombarded with doomer tweets that say things like the world of 2019 will never return or we will always have to revolve our lives around Covid or you will always have to prove your vax status and wear a mask wherever you go for the rest of your life. Even though I know that the people saying these things are lying, I cant help but feel depressed when I read these things. 2019 was one of the best years of my life. I started college, made a new group of friends, got my drivers permit, and got autographs from some of my favorite voice actors at AnimeNYC. To hear people say that well never be able to experience those days again just sounds so disheartening to someone like me. I just wish there was a way to stop my urge to scroll through Twitter, or at least stop myself from coming across the tweets that are making me feel miserable.",

        "Reddit Post": "My wife and I live in a big urban area, as do some of her immediate family members, including her parents. We are all generally pretty good about taking Covid seriously, which includes wearing masks and getting the vaccine. Back in April, we attended the funeral of my mother-in-laws sister, which took place in a small rural town a few hours away where Covid is not taken seriously at all. When the funeral took place, my in-laws were fully vaccinated but I was only partially vaccinated. We get to the funeral, which was held indoors with probably 75-100 people present, and not a soul in there was wearing a mask, except me. For whatever reason, my family members decided to drop their precautions and go along with the majority consensus of the group and forget about Covid. I was very troubled by this, so the next morning I texted some of them and asked why they did not wear masks. I made a point to not bother texting my mother-in-law, though, because she had just buried her sister, after all. So I texted my father-in-law, and he did not take too kindly to the question. He said he felt it wasnt appropriate or necessary to wear a mask under the circumstances and that each person had to make their own decision. This was quite baffling to me because all of a sudden my father-in-law was starting to sound like the type of person you hear about who downplays Covid, even though hes happy to criticize people in other contexts when they disregard Covid safety protocols. I pointed out to him that CDC guidelines, at the time, stated that you should still wear masks, even when fully vaccinated. Anyway, he clearly told my mother-in-law that I posed this question, because I just found out that she is still upset, 4 months later, that I would even ask in the aftermath of her sisters funeral. My question is, was I correct to bring up the question? In my view, the virus doesnt care about what setting we are in so we should take precautions regardless. Or should I have just kept my mouth shut? How do you deal with Covid safety at an event where emotions are high?",
