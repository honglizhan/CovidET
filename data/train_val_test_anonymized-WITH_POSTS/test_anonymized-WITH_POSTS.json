I lost my uncle who is my best friend, we lived abroad all our lives but because of the pandemic I returned home, and barely managed to see him those 2 years. He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return. But he barely lasted a week before his death. But mentally I am exhausted of living here, of the pandemic, of having my friends all abroad and getting out of contact, of being alone to face his death. To face this life. Life feels so tasteless.",

Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.",

Every health professional that Ive seen regarding it hasnt seemed to think its that much of a big deal as Im medicated and blood work looks fine, but I will be on meds for it for the rest of my life. I dont trust what these health professionals are telling me because they all seem to have different opinions and some have willingly admitted that they dont know enough about autoimmune diseases. Ive been told that Im not at any greater risk of getting covid because of my disease, but have read differently. Im concerned about getting the vaccine because Ive heard from another doctor that its linked to autoimmune responses, but I cant find much online about the matter and Im afraid that if I dont get the vaccine, Ill be putting myself at greater risk. However, Im also afraid that the vaccine will cause further autoimmune problems, as the disease I already have is already a lot to deal with especially when I cant find a health professional that knows enough about it to help me. Im hoping someone here might be able to drop some knowledge?",

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.",

After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time. Does what I describe track with anyone's experience? I wonder for how long I'll be unable to exercise without precipitating unwanted flare-ups of Covid symptoms or Covid vaccine side effects.",

That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before.

        "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.",

I decided not to get the second shot with my doctor's support, because I've been so unwell that they say my body needs a break. I was hospitalized for a rapid heartbeat and chest pain 2 weeks ago which I was told is pleurisy. The pain has only gotten worse, but the doctor told me that it will eventually go away. I can't drive anymore because I don't have the strength in my arms to navigate the steering wheel. I can't even pick up a water glass with one hand. I sleep 3 or 4 hours a nite because the pain keeps waking me up. I made the tough decision today to withdraw from school this term because I just feel so delirious a lot of the time now that my brain can't do it. These physical and mental effects are just making me feel pretty bummed out and sad. I know that I'm lucky to not have it as bad as many other people during these Covid times. But I feel really alone in this, as everyone around me is getting vaccinated and going out and enjoying life, right as I'm getting so sick and homebound. I have faith that this will get better, I'm just having a hard time accepting that I need to put my life on hold until it does. Support, kind words, anything, much appreciated. And to add again - please get vaccinated! My experience is very rare and everyone I know had minimal side effects, if any. That's part of what's making me feel so alone in this!",

        "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with <ORG>. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.",

Im more nervous about the restrictions that come with these surges and that if a big surge happens colleges will switch to online learning which i really dont want to happen since I miss my friends in my college state. I was feeling so much better mentally weeks ago and felt super optimistic because of low numbers and I feel like this delta variant has just put a wrench in that. I know that since Im fully vaccinated I dont need to worry a whole lot about it but I just dont want to see a repeat of 100,000 cases a day and different restrictions. I just want these variants to stop because it seems like everytime Im semi happy a new one makes a surprise and turns out to be more contagious. Anyways thanks for reading this rant",

I was recently mentioning this to a friend who told me that this was overkill since apparently new research has shown it is not needed. Is this true? The friend also sides with the CDC over WHO regarding mask usage for vaccinated people so I'm apprehensive to listen to them. If there is research along these lines then I it saying it is not possible to spread through groceries/deliveries or that it is simply a lower chance. If it matters, I'm fully vaccinated with <ORG>.

Very few countries are exempt from this, almost entirely small islands around the world. Meanwhile Denmark's infection numbers have doubled, yay European football events. So the hopes of ever getting on the UK's green list are smaller and smaller. I have since the start of this whole thing been worrying about loved ones. First my elderly grandparents for being high risk, then my best friend who had her baby very premature, then my mum was bedridden for months due to covid, and now my dad has cancer and has to have chemo. It has been almost a full year since I saw a single family member, more than a year for many of them. And not even a glimmer of hope. I am fully vaccinated even, and I am watching people here happy about losing restrictions, but I am so scared of losing someone after being away for so long and it's getting more and more overwhelming. I know nobody can say magic words to fix things, I just really needed to vent about how it's July 2021 and this is still ongoing for the foreseeable future.",

My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that. TLDR; Any tips as to how to get out of my head and regain that sense of safety to be alone again after suffering anxiety because of the pandemic?",

While Im out, Ive surprisingly found Im quite bored when I leave my house, but the real problem comes the day afterwards. I sit and think was that too soon? Can I re-enter my bubble now that people have seen me? Am I a hypocrite? And these questions flow through my brain in a never ending sequence. Feeling that Ive been perceived by others and I cant take it back feels unbearable, yet I took the decision to leave my house so I then encounter feelings of embarrassment, guilt and shame. Not to mention the obvious fear of the delta variant, and overall uncertainty over cdc recommendations. (I wish someone could spell out a good plan for reintegration besides - rip off the mask and live!) Everyone I know has returned to life normally and Im here in a weird limbo. I know a lot of people in this struggle with just leaving the house, but is anyone else out there struggling with how they feel once they do?",

That we dont know the long term effects. But I got it anyway. And now Im starting to think about it more. Ive always been a hypochondriac. And lately, Ive been aware of my heartbeat. When Im resting, I can feel it in my chest by itself. I remember reading an article about teens having heart problems or palpitations after getting the vaccine. And now Im worried that Im one of those people. But I also dont know if it could be other things. Maybe its because Im inactive. Or how I eat. I dont know. Im getting my 2nd vaccine shot on Friday. But if my heart thing is vaccine related, wont it get worse? Im scared. You cant unvaccinate yourself. If I get my second and it gives me heart problems the rest of my life, Im screwed. I survived covid once. What if I made a mistake? I dont know anymore. Im scared of both things. I hate being a hypochondriac.",

If it is, then please suggest a better place to post it (in this thread, or in a PM, or via whatever form of communication suits you. Regarding the mask. I say \"covid filtration efficiency\" because I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for. I assume I should be looking at \"viral filtration efficiency\" scores/tests but for what particle size? I seem to recall hearing that your typical covid aerosol is about 0.3 micrometers in diameter but I could definitely be wrong about that. I'm guessing I can simply close off a valve with some kind of solid object, but I'm not sure. Certainly, I want to avoid risking spreading the virus to others in the case that I become infected (I suppose one might argue that with properly wearing a very protective mask I am unlikely to be infected in the first place. Don't ask me about the legitimacy of that argument though) The goal here is to get a mask with a high degree of protection against covid. My mother is aged and smokes a lot and my country is in the middle of a covid delta variant spike so I need a high degree of protection. Whether I'm severely paranoid or otherwise, 95% filtration efficiency is not enough to satisfy me. You have my thanks in advance for your assistance, and my apologies for any imposition.",

Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying. My immediate family knows that I suffer with it, but no one aside from my brother really understands the levity of how crippling it can be. I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop spiraling and calming myself down around everyone? Will having these spiraling thoughts about COVID hurting my loved ones and I ever going to end?",

There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(<ORG>). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite. Like I have the caveman syndrome when it comes to larger groups. How do you evaluate the situation? I guess I just need some opinions on it. Thanks for reading so far!:)",

I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose. However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts. Not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but I cant think of anything else If this was due to the vaccine, does that put me at any risk of having a severe allergic reaction with the second dose? Second, I am a woman in my early twenties. Ive heard reports of myocarditis after the second dose in young people. This is quite scary to me as Im very active. Should I be concerned?

I live in Italy and here we had three lockdowns, the last one ending around May. They left me absolutely burnt out. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore. A lot of nice things are happening to me: I am graduating on Monday, I got my vaccine and maybe my boyfriend will finally be able to come visit after 18 months of not seeing each other. But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again. I hadn't been on antidepressants since 2019 and now I lost all my progress. I feel so guilty because my family and friends are all so excited and proud of me but I feel empty, scared and sad all the time. I just wish this never happened.",

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish. Support and advice appreciated - thanks y'all",

They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.",

With that said, Im now seeing more and more reports (including this <ORG> report: [url] saying that the new Delta variant will cause the country as a whole to have to reimplement mask and social distancing requirements, especially in states with lower vaccination rates. Consequently, Im feeling increasingly worried that Ill come back in August only to find its gone back to not being safe to see anyone and classes have gone back to being mostly (if not completely) virtual, especially since my home state is one of those mUh FrEeDoMs states with low vaccination rates (granted, Im sure theyd be hesitant to require masks for the same reason, but a lack of that requirement doesnt change how safe or not safe things are).

I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the <ORG> vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like \"i can't, i need to study/work\", \"I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me?

So why are there no TREATMENTS? Since the pandemic started scientists have been testing vitamin D and freaking hydroxychloroquine over and over and over again. Let's try other strategies. Let's have a new \"operation warp speed\" and develop new drugs. Let's try antifibrotics to prevent lung fibrosis. Because I'm so tired of people saying \"vaccines prevent against hospitalization!\". I don't want to just avoid being hospitalized, I want to avoid permanent lung damage. People with mild or even asymptomatic covid are often left with permanent lung damage, but no one is talking about it. Do you want COPD and fibrosis lungs? I certainly don't. I'm moving to the UK soon and with tbe Delta variant raging I feel like a sitting duck. I'm so scared and hopeless because if I get Covid there's nothing I can do to save my lungs from fibrosing. We have to learn to \"live with covid\", so where are the treatments to make it tolerable?",

I was 34 when COVID started and now Im 35, but I feel SO OLD. Like, covid aged me and I crossed a threshold from young adult to middle aged all of the sudden. I feel like any hope/positivity I had in the past is gone now and replaced by never ending existential dread. I have always been depressive, but it was about stuff that could be changed like my weight - not depression at an existential level. Its bigger than covid - once we get through this, society is gonna be permanently changed and I wouldnt be surprised if this results in either civil war in the US or some sort of world war. And climate change is gonna accelerate and were just going to let it happen and well all die. I dunno - I was aware of political instability and the gravity of climate change before covid... but neither was really a tangible and present threat like it feels like it is now. I guess I miss that sense of general security and ignorance. I miss that I could listen to music, spend time with friends/family, work - without constantly thinking whats the point?",

I have even made plans to finally fly down my boyfriend to come visit me in my apartment at the start of August in a few weeks. Then this delta variant starts becoming the main thing in the news being reported about and i feel my fear setting in again. I still really want to see my boyfriend has he bought the tickets already and we made plans on how to be super safe while at the airport to the best of his ability. Im just still so terrified that somehow he will get a breakthrough infection despite being fully vaccinated (moderna) and masked up and somehow will be able to pass it on to me via breakthrough infection. To my knowledge cases are still pretty low and he lives in MN and coming to my state which is Georgia where we plan to get him as quickly as possible out of the airport come home and sanitize some things. Even with all the precautions we are taking im still worried that something might happen but i don't know if its my overwhelming covid anxiety or what.

This person was not an anti-vax, just ambivalent and lazy. Me expressing my concern helped them over the finish line, and this is the first person I can say that I am personally responsible for getting the vaccine besides myself. One person doesn't sound like a lot but really one person is worth it. I encourage everyone to think about someone in your life right now who is unvaccinated but just might need a steady hand to hold to get them down off the fence, and try for them, if you have the mental energy for it. Something that helped my friend is telling him how effective the vaccines are at keeping vaccinated people out of the hospital. Good luck!",

A friend will fly to visit two days after I got my second shot, and I am wondering how safe it is for me to meet with somebody shortly after getting my last dose? Will the vaccine already protect me at its full potential, or how much will it be? I have read all sorts of articles that say basically something between 30% and 90%??? This person will also get his second shot a few days before but is not as concerned as I am about it. He has contact with people at his job, and is basically going out and traveling again - wearing a mask and distancing ofc. I have been in isolation and wear a mask everywhere I go since the pandemic started. I am mostly concerned by long covid and other diseases that can be triggered by it. Thanks in advance!",

The reason I ask this? As much as I have done my part in wearing masks, I have grown weary of it, and I find them super uncomfortable to breathe in. Only time I would ever consider using them is in cold weather OR if I'm under the weather, but I'm at the point where I feel it is no longer necessary. Which is why I'm holding off on traveling until the mask mandate is gone. When I mentioned this on another subforum, others thought I was crazy and started pushing masks on me. I was offended that they weren't respecting my choice because I firmly feel uncomfortable traveling as long as the virus is around and as long as the mask mandate is on there. That's why I'm hoping that April 2022 will be a better time to travel to Florida than right now.",

Their maid of honour has rented a whole house for 3 days in a place 4 hours away. This would mean staying with approximately 12 other people, most who I dont know, not to mention sharing a bed and room etc. They have also planned lots of activities like paintball, laser tag, cocktail classes and dinners. Im feeling super anxious about the whole thing: 1. Because of Covid. I currently work in ICU, I caught Covid last year and had a real rough time recovering, and Ive barely gone out much except with close family. I am double vaccinated so that at least helps. At present, its actually against our guidelines to have so many people inside from different households, but this is meant to change at the end of July - unless cases continue to rise which they are. 2. Because of guilt if I decline and dont go, I dont want to let my friend down, I think she would probably stop inviting me places/to her wedding. And no one else in the group seems anxious over Covid, theyre all excited about going. I feel like if I say I cant go because of Covid, the group will all try and convince me it will be safe to go. I honestly dont know what to do, I know if I say I will go Im going to have so much anxiety all month leading up to it. I have to reply to the invite in the next few days. If anyone has been in this situation or has advice I would really appreciate it :)",

So far, the Upper East is not, but I do fear that there may be chances of us being blown back to square one and all the progress we've made so far being thrown out the window. I hope that doesn't happen, but based on how I've seen the cases climb lately (although today they WERE at 8k), I wonder if I'm overanalyzing this.

Now that things are the way they are in the US, I've been trying to make an effort to see each of my friends at least once this summer, especially as I'll be moving across the country at the end of August. But these days, I've been finding myself completely wiped out after meeting up with one friend for 2-3 hours. As in... after I get home, I spend the rest of the day slowly building up the energy to even do minor errands around the house (but most of the time I just sink into the couch and stare at the TV for the rest of the day). I've also been purposely scheduling only one hangout every 3-4 days as my energy levels are only really better after that many days. Is this completely out of the ordinary? Pre-pandemic, I used to be able to handle seeing my coworkers every day, socializing and interacting with them throughout the day and at lunch, and would usually schedule dinner or a hangout with a friend every other day no problem. I feel so wrung out and tired after these hangouts, that I'm not even sure I've had fun by the end of them... I've tried to leave early a couple times too, but maybe my hints aren't strong enough, because I find that my friends don't say goodbye until I really emphasize that I have something to do at home. I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired. I want to just say no to 90% of these hangouts but I also feel guilty since I'm leaving and basically set hard limits on in-person hangouts prior to being vaccinated. &amp;#x200B; I don't even know what the purpose of this post is... but I just spent the last 6 hours recovering from a 3 hour hang out. Can anyone else relate?",

I've definitely been put through the ringer in the past year and a half - I lost my job which meant my right to live in the UK hung in the balance for a few months, and obviously didn't see any family or friends back home in the US. As of mid-June, I've been fully vaccinated so I flew back to the US to spend time with family during the month of July. I am really happy to see everyone I love, but I'm also experience immense anxiety. I think the thought of going back to normal, when it ISN'T normal and covid is still a threat, is causing me to spiral. It doesn't feel real to be back home, for one. Sometimes, it feels like I'm dissociating because somewhere that's so familiar feels foreign. I feel anxious and guilty about travelling with the variants circulating, and going out (despite the fact I avoid crowded areas and still wear masks indoors). It's setting off other anxieties as well, like intrusive thoughts of suddenly dying or dying early. There's no real point of this post I guess, I just wanted to say it and see if anyone felt similarly. I just had a breakdown and I'm so tired of feeling this way. All I want is to go back to London and be with my boyfriend to have that shred of safety that I felt throughout the pandemic.",

If he hears that I went to a workout class or got a haircut indoors, he sighs deeply and tells me that Ive disappointed him. He also makes judgmental comments constantly to everyone for doing anything that involves going almost everywhere. This isnt too bad for me, because I moved out and live independently. But its really hard on my mom who lives with him. He gets mad at her for going on walks outside and constantly criticizes her. I worry very much about their mental health. Sometimes I think about standing up to him more, telling him he cant tell me what to do, but I know it probably wouldnt do any good. I know hes functioning out of anxiety. Does anyone have a relative that has become extremely (and unhealthily) judgmental and controlling, and if so, how do you cope with it?",

When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I am so conflicted on what to do because, in a selfish way, I dont want to wear a mask because I just want to go back to normal. On the other hand, I would feel guilty if I got Covid and gave it to my unvaccinated brother. I am still weighing the pros and cons because I am healthy teenager but I know the Delta Variant is the most dangerous strains yet. I care so much about my brother and protecting others that I am scared I might make the wrong decision. What should I do?",

        "Reddit Post": "Im going into my second year of college. For reference, I was a 2020 high school grad so I was one of the thousands who was robbed of an actual graduation, prom, senior activities, etc. Then my first year of college was also kinda sucky. First semester of my freshman year, I stayed home and did courses online because I was nervous about the virus and getting infected. Also wanted to protect people and being younger, I had a fear of spreading it to older people. Second semester of college, I actually moved on campus where I met a lot of friends and had fun. But I always wore my mask, hung out with a few friends who also always protected themselves, and never went to parties despite most of the student body going to these parties every week. School starts next month and things are pretty much back to normal. No masks required. Full stadiums. Sorority events in-person. All of it which Im super excited about. As the first person to go to college in my family, this was the college life I was so excited to live. Especially since college is such a short time experience and Im already 25% through with it. BUT I feel like COVID and the Delta variant (possibly the Lambda as well) will take that away from me again. So I have a fear of school shutting down later this fall and having another year ruined due to the variant and things just going in the wrong direction just like what happened to my senior year. But I also have a fear that Im being selfish by trying to have a normal year and just live life carefree, that would put people/the community in danger. How do I combat these fears mentally?",

We set up for a bbq and were drinking beers, we let each other try the beers we each got etc. I left in the early evening and went home an hour away. She was up that night with a high fever and puking she told me yesterday. I knew it was gonna end up covid and told my employer I'd been exposed. The CDC doesnt require isolation for vaccinated people who have been exposed so I'm at work still with my mask on. I got the JnJ in March. I'm not sure how effective it is against the Delta variant as I hear it works, but am also seeing in my area there's been a lot of breakthrough cases for some reason. I was just reading an article yesterday about a weird outbreak among the vaccinated in the state above me where she lives. Just looking for some support or facts on whether I'm relatively safe or not. It'd be one thing if it was a brief exposure, but we spent 2 days together eating and drinking etc. I'm also worried about her as she has an autoimmune disorder and she woke up today with weird bruising. I don't know. This whole past year and a half has been awful.",

Im not worried about what is in the vaccines, I know whats in them, they seem relatively safe. Im not overly worried about the side effects because they are mild in most cases. My family are all vaccinated and they are all completely fine. Here is where my anxiety comes from. Im scared of what these vaccines could maybe, *maybe*, end up causing in the future. According to my own research on the subject, Vaccines cant really cause things like cancer or anything. But, there is no guarantee that the vaccines wont cause a different serious illness. Im insanely conflicted. This new delta variant is honestly terrifying me, people younger than me are dying because of it, and Im only 18! I want to get vaccinated, I really do, I want protection from this horrific virus but Im really nervous. Id just like some support, maybe somebody more knowledgeable on the subject could help put my anxieties to rest. Thank you in advance.",

I was hopeful to be able to maybe start and go do small things like outdoor farmers markets (with my child) or even possibly to go into a store (haven't been since before lockdown). With restrictions lifted, it makes the world seem a lot scarier for me to bring my child out there. He hasn't been able to tolerate a mask due to sensory issues - so we have only been to essential dr appointments. Lately, even things like having maintenance or contractors come into my apartment to fix long standing overdue issues seems too hard and I'm avoiding it because my child is unvaccinated and they technically don't have to wear masks inside my apartment I guess. How are those of you with kids navigating all of this? We haven't gotten take out or been in a store this entire time and I know I need to somehow ease back into life and existence because maintaining this level of isolation is really starting to damage my mental health to the point where I don't even know how to interact in the world anymore. We drove past a busy ice cream place a few nights ago and instead of thinking about stopping and enjoying life - I cried. Seeing everyone without masks, close together, kids everywhere - and knowing my little kid isn't protected is so hard. It sends me into a full panic and I feel left behind in this scary place where I have lost all sense of what's safe, what's not and no idea how to move ahead while life just keeps going past and we sit in the same spot. My child has missed out on absolutely everything and I want him to have some normalcy, but I also want to be responsible and limit his exposure as much as possible. Other parents seem ok to travel and be out and about with their kids and I am just totally afraid to do the smallest things.",

I have a weekend trip planned with a friend that I haven't seen in almost 2 years. I'm traveling from Seattle, WA and going to Spokane, WA. On day 1 we planned to stay at her place, and on day 2 we planned to stay in downtown Spokane and share a hotel room. I assumed she was vaccinated and agreed to these plans weeks ago. Once plans were settled I made sure to confirm vaccination status between us and she said that she is NOT vaccinated. I'm not entirely sure how safe it is to be around someone indoors and outdoors when they're unvaccinated. I'd also like to mention that my boyfriend has cystic fibrosis (hes vaccinated) and I'm worried about coming home and figuring out what precautions I need to take for that. Unvaccinated individuals in Washington state all have to wear masks in public, and while vaccinated individuals don't, the CDC website doesn't really go into broad descriptions on my specific concerns in their FAQ's section. Is it completely unreasonable to avoid staying at her place, and that I get my own separate hotel room? Will she need to continue to wear a mask around me while we're indoors hanging out, or in the car?? How should we proceed with hanging out outside?",

From what it looks like Los Angeles has not yet completed its round of vaccinations. There are still Latinos and others who have yet to receive the shot. L.A. isn't where it needs to be just yet. So of course the restrictions are coming back. That said, does this mean the same thing will happen everywhere in the United States? No. There are other regions that are highly vaccinated where such mandates will probably not be necessary. Aside from Los Angeles, where else in California have masks been mandated? That said if you are vaccinated, you are still well protected. And better yet, if you live in a region where the virus is not circulating, then of course it's safe to take off your mask. Highland Park in NJ is one such place. NJ is also one of the highly vaccinated states, so it's not facing much danger. Once again, this is just UNVACCINATED people. Does it mean these restrictions are going to be forever and that we'll never get our lives back? Does it mean we'll have to live like this forever? No and no. And a thousand times no. Fact: the children's vaccine is coming for September. Remember? THAT is another pocket of unvaccinated people who need to take the shot. Only then can we start to make anymore dents. That said, if you live in Los Angeles County, I understand how you feel. It IS heartbreaking, and it's unfortunate it's come down to this. But simultaneously, it's just a reminder that more people have to be vaccinated over there. And I'm sorry you have to go through this. But once again, we will NOT have to do this forever. There is still a good chance that this will all be over by the end of the year. Do not -- I repeat, DO NOT -- give up hope. This WILL end.",

It's one big room and they only have 2-3 staff present with not more than three patients at a time. Okay, that's all fine and dandy, but today I walked in and they're finishing up with a new patient who is wearing his mask under his nose. My first thought is just the usual eye roll and judgements about people who behave this way. Then I come to terms with the fact that they were treating him and allowing this behavior, which IMO makes their mask policy complete BS. So, here's the thing, I'm vaccinated but I have a medically at-risk kid who is too young to get jabbed. Delta spread is high in our county and from what I've read, it might be more transmittable even by vaccinated people. I'm about halfway through my expected treatment and seeing good progress. I also really like my therapist. But, honestly I 'm feeling like I don't want to step foot back in that place. I'm torn between just cancelling the rest of my appointments or how I might confront them about the issue?",

The results from the trial for kids 5-11 are not going to be until September. Waiting an additional 4 months after that would be absolutely disastrous for both children AND schools. Considering that some schools are not requiring mask mandates I fear the consequences will be stiff. That's why I would prefer for the vaccine to come out sooner than that so that we do not have disasters like this happen. As someone who works with kids, I am very, very concerned about this and do not want to see children continue to be deprived of this vaccine for any longer than necessary.",

Is the Delta Variant a problem, yes. But only for unvaccinated. That's all. They also said masking is only advisable in areas where there are low vaccination rates, not high ones. As disappointing as it is about L.A., keep in mind that this is on account of half the population not being highly vaccinated. So while they didn't say anything we didn't already know, they are still using calming rhetoric. Which isn't to say you should drop your guard in an unvaccinated area. There's a reason for that. But having said that, they ARE working at trying to get more people vaccinated. The Delta Variant is NOT a reset presser, just another obstacle. But it IS one that CAN be overcome with more vaccinations. The more we do so the better. So try not to obsess too much about this if you're vaccinated and continue to live your life. Don't panic so much, keep in mind, we will still be able to crush this virus and end the pandemic. Nobody should lose faith now.",

My mother also questions covid a lot, she does 'believe' it exists as well, she's not entirely against all the measurements (apart from a few obvious ridiculous ones we have to deal with here in Southern Spain) however my sister convinced her to also not take the vaccine (my mother is 63). On another side note, my father does 'believe' it all and even got his 2nd second as of 2 weeks ago.

I really don't want that to happen, it would feel like falling just before the finish of a marathon. However, I can't just lock myself up for 3 weeks, because I have my lil' job as a postwoman. Even if I could just stay home, I live with my dear SO who wouldn't agree with being locked up, and I get that, it'd be extreme. Also, I've been hearing someone who lives above or next to us (I'm not sure) coughing horribly this whole day. Every time I hear it my mind becomes anxious. It's such a nasty cough and it makes me think about covid immediately :(( It comes so close this way, eventhough there's a wall - luckily!",

I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it. I know I shouldn't be this nervous and scared, but the recent news of the Delta HAD shaken me somewhat and I am worried that I might end up catching the virus with the reports I'm hearing of people taking the vaccine getting sick from the virus still. I'm sorry I sound like I'm such a mess, but I felt scared throughout and I wanted to have some opinions on whether I put myself in danger or not.",

The CDC is disgraceful for only counting breakthrough cases that result in hospitalization or death, and not actual cases. They dont realize that even mild or asymptotic cases can still have a negative effect on ones body. I really think we need to do more research on just how many breakthrough cases there are after full vaccination. I know vaccines arent 100% and they never will be, but infection shouldnt be very common either, otherwise we are clearly seeing waning immunity or resistance to variants, and boosters should be looked into. I personally am worried about breakthrough cases, even mild ones, since I dont want to have a loss of taste and smell or even long covid. It has not yet been proven definitively if vaccines prevent long covid should you come into contact with covid 19 after vaccination. I feel like they should have waited to make the vaccines, if they could have, until they knew more about the virus, but we couldnt wait due to dramatic loss of life. Even still, Im happy they approved the vaccines so quickly.",

        "Reddit Post": "My dad died back in January of Covid-19, after spending a month in the hospital and 2 weeks in a medically-induced coma. I couldn't travel for the funeral because, well, pandemic. I booked a hotel for the end of July because I figured we'd all be vaccinated by then and it'd be reasonably safe to travel. My mom needs help dealing with my dad's stuff, and I want to pick out some mementos of my favorite parent. I think I was wrong. I'm vaccinated (<ORG>) and my mother and sibling are, too (moderna+natural immunity). The rest of Kentucky is sucking at vaccination. Where I live: [2.6 daily new cases per 100k people, 64% at least partially vaccinated]([url] Where they are: [16 new cases daily per 100k people. 39% at least partially vaccinated]([url] The plan is to drive 15 hours, stay in a hotel, and cook in the room or get takeout. Masks with filters, hand sanitizer obsessively. Avoid my partner for a week once I get back, masking whenever in common areas. If anyone gives me grief about masking, just tell them \"Hi, for context: I'm halfway through a 16-hour roadtrip to help my mom pick out my dad's headstone. What was it you needed to tell me?\" (I'm autistic. Scripts are good.) Is this too risky? I can still cancel the hotel and rebook later. Antsy skippable backstory: I totally blame my mom for killing my dad. She brought Covid home after attending a \"mandatory work Christmas breakfast party\". My dad was definitely vulnerable to the disease, having a history of heart problems. I'm still very very upset and pissed at her. She's a narcissist that's been playing the \"grieving widow\" card since before my dad died. While he was in a coma, she whined to me that dating as a widow is such a balancing act: date too soon and people judge you for it. Date too late and people think you're just so sad. Anyway, lots of emotions. Thanks in advance for your advice.",

I thought that I would get some peace when I got the vaccine (as did all the people I generally come in contact with at any great length) and could stop worrying so much. But then they start talking about breakthrough infections or people who are immuno-suppressed not as protected. Not sure where that leaves me as I have no spleen. I do get plenty of white blood cells when I have some issue, but don't know if that is the same as a broken immune system as it relates to COVID. No one seems to have a straight answer, although I do know there are studies working on that question. On top of that, my housemate, who is vaccinated as well, got a new job at a popular restaurant in town that apparently doesn't have any mask requirements. They didn't even ask if she'd been vaccinated, which means that they probably hire those that aren't. She is excited for the job, but I'm worried that she'll pick up the delta variant as now they say that even casual encounters can get someone infected. And I'm worried that she'll bring home the virus and I'll be compromised, even though I hope neither of us would wind up sick enough to be hospitalized or die. Not to mention going to Walmart was like a nightmare this morning. I was wearing a mask, but it seemed like I was one of the few. Our county is only 27% vaccinated and yet 90% of the people there had no masks because since they lifted the mask requirements, everybody's honor seems to have gone awry. I almost had a panic attack when a guy without a mask coughed near me and the guy got too close. I hate having to be scared of the idea that someone's breath could be like a bullet to the brain, only more agonizing.

        "Reddit Post": "So, long story short, I am in the US to get a vaccine. I'm not living here and I have a small window of time. Got my first shot, my next one is a little over a week away. After that I have just enough time to let it kick in (to be honest, a couple days short, I messed up my flights a bit) before I fly out again. My luck has been horrific for this whole pandemic though, and of course I can't count on anything going well, so I'm unsurprised that I have managed to crack an entire molar and I need to get it looked at urgently. In spite of being pretty good about my dental hygiene in the past, I've put off my annual dentist check ups for two years because of this shitty pandemic. I kind of have to do something about this, but I'm scared. Rationally I know I have some protection nearly two weeks out from my first jab, and there's a strong chance that the dentists I see here would all have been vaccinated ages ago. I guess I could try to push it off even longer, but when I return to my home country, I'm going to a place where there are way less vaccinations that have been distributed, so I think I'd be more nervous. My luck isn't great and this year has been super hard, I just don't want it to get worse if I can help it at all. Most other doctors visits wouldn't be as scary because I could mask up accordingly... but this is mentally tricky, it's the one thing where I suddenly have to have my mouth wide open around a bunch of strangers for an unknown procedure. My partner is encouraging me to just go now, even though I'm waiting for my second shot, because it's really not great to have this. So, I'm bracing myself, because I think my partner is correct, but my anxiety is firing on all cylinders. Does anyone have some reassurance around going and getting dental work done? Words of encouragement? Has anyone had to go do some emergency dental work during the pandemic?",

My other friend and I who I live with immediately started isolating, informed my work and they told me to keep coming in. Around Wednesday friend started showing symptoms, we both got tests Thursday and results yesterday. He was positive I was negative so he went into isolation in his room. This morning I woke up with aches and took my temp and it was higher than normal 100.9. Not too bad but am fairly certain it means I have covid. They've both lost their senses of taste, the first friend had more symptoms she had a high fever and was puking, fatigued, says today it's hard to breathe but she's fine otherwise. Friend I live with has a cough qnd headaches and congestion but energy is fine. I turn 30 in 2 days, the whole thing just sucks. If it's rare how did we all get it? We've all been fully vaxxed for a couple months. I feel like I just never understand what's happening even though I'm constantly reading about it. Just venting I guess",

And then there's people saying \"lock down until a certain % are vaccinated\" but here in America we've basically hit the ceiling. Anyone who wanted to be vaccinated has been vaccinated. Now what? Literally everyone around me has expressed how awful the past year and a half has been. Teenagers who have fallen into a depression and lost all their social skills, kids who lost their precious childhood years, adults who are overwhelmed with zero outside support, the elderly in nursing homes where they can't be visited.

Our son on the other hand is only 4, and can't get vaccinated. We know the risk to him is low and that he's very likely to be fine if he does get it. We've been seeing our immediate family members and close friends who are all vaccinated, but we've stayed away from everyone we know who isn't vaccinated. The issue were having is that the majority of both of our families are anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. One of our friends in our usual group is anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. Most of them, especially the ones that want to see us, acted like covid didn't exist and were out all the time. These people now want to see us, or are being invited to all the functions so the only way to avoid them is to not go. My MIL, and some of our other vaccinated friends are giving us a hard time and making us feel like we're being ridiculous by not seeing our unvaccinated family and friends. So my question is are we being ridiculous? Are we being overly cautious when we shouldn't be? Because a lot of people are making us feel like we are. We know the chances of him getting really sick are low, but also realize that the people who want to see us/him are not taking any precautions and seeing a ton of other non-vax people. They also are the type of people that won't work with us by taking precautions themselves. Tl;Dr- Wife and I are vaccinated, 4 year old isn't. Unvaccinated family/friends want us to hang out with them with our son. Are we being ridiculous by not wanting to take our son around anti-covid vaxers who also don't wear masks and go out all the time and hang out with a ton of other anti-vaxers?",

Ive since pursued counseling for my anxiety and depression, and this combined with the pandemic situation getting better has helped a ton with my mental health issues. However, now theyre saying this Delta variant is going to make things bad again, and it almost feels like were going to end up back at square one again (even as someone who is fully vaccinated again).

I've been reading about the breakthrough cases with Delta and it's making me a little nervous than I was about a month or so ago. Especially since I am in Florida where cases or more or less on the rise. I know the vaccines arent 100% effective, but It just makes me very nervous to be going on a plane knowing that the Delta Variant is spreading. Luckily if I were to get it, my mom and everyone around me is vaccinated, so that helps. But, I watched a Tik Tok Video of someone saying that they caught a covid breakthrough case, and I keep reading stuff on Reddit about covid breakthrough cases, and my mom is watching like CNN and well it's CNN. Should I honestly be that concerned about becoming a breakthrough case?",

According to graphs in Scotland, the variant may hit hard and fast, but it ultimately doesn't do as bad a damage as other variants. In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy. That's attributed to how much vaccinations we have made. The more people we do this to, the better. I hope I am not giving any false hopes, but this post DID have me intrigued.",

Anyway I saw this article today on NBC news as website and believe it or not it makes me feel a whole lot better. According to this article 27 states have kept monitoring their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations have started. According to this the totals are around 65,000, though to be fair thats not accurate since more than likely theres many more of those other 23 states so for the sake of argument lets assume that all of those other states have the exact same amount so will make our maximum amount 130,000. Then we extrapolate that against the 160 MILLION who are fully vaccinated. That means that statistically 99.92% of people with full vaccinations have not gotten breakthrough infections.

Majority of my peers tell me they have been experiencing heart problems ever since they got the vaccine which terrifies me and I am also scared for them! I know they say the risk is so small but I don't want to be added to that number. They literally recommended me not to get vaccinated, and then the people online call me an idiot because I am not.

One of the friends girlfriends wasnt feeling well so she skipped the happy hour. Again it was outdoors and we are all vaxxed!! Yesterday, my husband developed a dry cough. Went away overnight. However, he woke up around 3am feeling feverish. Feverish feeling went away but hes been sneezy today. I just have a scratchy throat, but I always have a scratchy throat due to allergies and living in Austin. Today I found out that one of the people we met up with on Friday tested positive thru antigen test but they feel like they just have allergies. So multiple exposures we probably have covid. What would be the point in getting tested? Mask mandates were finally lifted at my office but Im putting mine back on just to protect others. Im just feeling so discouraged about our future as a society. I want people to feel safe again. But all of this makes it seem like the vaccines dont work. We are also having our postponed wedding ceremony in October. We postponed from this May because we wanted people to ease back into normalcy and we werent sure people would have access to the vaccines! Doubt anyone will be excited to come now.",

Rather than inform employees, management/HR did all they could to keep new cases under wraps, so those who were in contact were not made aware of the risk. This obviously blew up in their face and there was no one to work for 2 months. There was never even any formal acknowledgement let alone apology for this incredible lapse in judgement. And <PERSON> doesn't believe there was ever any sort of investigation into the event, if that's a thing. Since then there has been significant turnover, with many new people who presumably have not yet been infected. Well apparently it's happening AGAIN, and the only reason any employees are aware are from sharing info with each other. Admin makes no effort to reach out to those working in proximity to others who may be sick, and are giving no explanation for why certain employees are mysteriously gone, not even to managers of said employees. It's complete lunacy, and <PERSON> has no idea what to do. He fears inaction, if not retaliation if talking directly to management. Is there some organization that he can report this to? To protect himself and other workers? This is in SoCal btw. Please let me know if I can provide more information, I was trying to crank this out as fast as I could. Thank you...",

Where I'm from they dropped the mask mandate for shopping under 7-day-case-rates of 10 and I'm also more and more surrounded by people who flaunt masks and precautions when needed/mandated- I feel as if it's already useless to argue with them. I suffer from pandemic fatigue more and more and I don't feel as if my behavior would benefit anyone anymore. I'm not one of those people who never cared - I cared for the last 1.5 years. But the longer it goes, my solidarity decreases. Then add the fact that I'm vaccinated already, but recently I'm more and more reading bad news regarding Delta vs the vaccines.

I'm not a social butterfly by any means and have had social anxiety in the past, but I was just starting to enjoying being around people, socializing after work etc pre-COVID. Now myself and colleagues (1000+) have been told that on return, we can come into the office and work, but all teams will be mixed together, and most people will be working from home - probably just a few. This means that I'll be working with a handful of people (who I don't work directly and do different roles completely). What makes me feel worse is that most people don't want to return to work. They have families, friends and good home lives which means not going into an office is no great loss to them. But for me, it *was* my social life. I know I shouldn't be complaining, I have a job, I've not got COVID and I'm surviving. But it makes me depressed and I guess I'm just mourning the loss of the trajectory my life was going pre-COVID",

I can't just go and tell people it's over and you'll never have to worry again, not when I don't think those are the facts. I know this is a support community, but support does not mean lying through your teeth to make people feel better! My perspective is that this is a serious crisis, but we are smart and strong and we can get through it. I want to offer realistic ideas about what the future will look like and useful tips to help people get through it. It bothers me that people seem to want me to say, \"Nothing bad will happen, you are perfectly safe, you can guarantee the safety of everyone around you, the pandemic will never hurt you,\" or, \"No, you'll never have to miss an event or wear a mask again,\" because those things just aren't true. They're comforting in the moment, but they only set you up for disappointment. I would prefer to say, \"You've been keeping yourself safer this way and this other way,\" or, \"Your mask might help keep your town from needing a lockdown,\" or, \"There are safer ways to socialize so you don't have to stay away from your friends.\" Maybe I don't get it, but isn't support supposed to be realistic? I would hate to be lied to. Always did, even as a little kid. Like, I wanted to know that the shot would hurt but that it wouldn't last long or be very painful; I didn't want to be lied to and told it wouldn't hurt a bit, and then feel betrayed when it did.",

They are all gathering, with other family members (some vaccinated some not) for a belated wake, and I made the decision not to go. In March of 2020, my husband and I had to decide not to travel when his father passed, because the risk of spreading covid to his mother/family was too great. Even though we are vaccinated now, too many of my family have chosen not to get vaccinated, and for the same reasons we held in March 2020, I dont want to either potentially transmit the delta variant to my mother, or be exposed to it- in the event my <ORG> vaccine is in need of a booster. My mother, of course does not understand my decision and cries every day when I talk to her. So of course I feel incredibly guilty, and also angry that my family is being insane. It feels like a crack in the foundation of our relationship is gaping open. I have no idea how to fix it or cope, and I just needed to vent, so thank you.",

It is clear that this delta variant is incredibly contagious but maybe not as strenuous to the healthcare system? After two to three months of normalcy, I fear that as a society, we will regress into our pre-vaccinated behavior. I dont know if that is the right move. How will we ever know if we need updated vaccines if we are all wearing masks again? Obviously children and immunocompromised need to take more precautions, but this is all feeling like two steps back. And please dont tell me that at least the death toll and hospitalization rates arent skyrocketing at the same rate. I am worried about our collective societys mental health. My friends that I have spoken to that recently tested positive and have mild symptoms despite being vaccinated are feeling betrayed by the vaccine. I dont think we should be feeling this way. I also understand a big source of anger is that so many unvaccinated people caused this spike. I feel like this argument is so futile because shouldnt have this been part of the equation or formula making?

Like everything is backsliding. Since J&amp;J and <PERSON> were dropped from the vaccine program here and given to a private company, those of us who received them are not on the regular vaccine plan anymore. At least not for this round, nothing has been planned for booster shots yet. So I can't just go and book a different shot. I already am terrified of my dad dying, especially dying after I have not seen him in over a year and a half. I also have elderly grandparents, my grandad is 91, who knows how long he has left? Now I am terrified this news will lead to J&amp;J being considered invalid in the EU and/or UK, I am already being kept away right now due to the UK only allowing people vaccinated inside the UK to non have to quarantine 10 days (but they allow nightclubs to be open?? \"Freedom day\" is also terrifying me), now even if that gets lifted I might still be screwed. This just feels like it is never going to end, and I feel with how so much of the world still has no access to vaccines we're going to get more and more variants that destroy our progress for getting some normalcy back.",

Knew I probably shouldn't go but I knew I was vaccinated so I thought I'd be fine. Fast forward to Sunday evening and im getting some fatigue/body aches and a scratchy throat. I've been dealing with some chronic acid reflux &amp; asthma stuff since March 2020 and have had spells of scratchy throats and body aches before so I figured it was just another one of those popping up. They usually went away in a day or two. The thought of going to the wrestling show was still in the back of my mind though. By Monday night I had a cough and congested sinuses. So finally this morning I got up and did a rapid test and sure enough it came back positive. Told everyone I went to the show with and everyone I'd seen since (including my parents ugh) and all got tested today or are getting tested tomorrow. Most from today have come back negative thankfully. So now im just sitting here with a sore throat, cough, stuffy nose and sinus headache crossing my fingers that it doesn't get any worse and that I didn't end up infecting my parents. Any other recovered breakthroughers on here? How long after the onset of your symptoms did it take to get better? \\--- Since writing this yesterday I've started to have some trouble breathing and 2 instances of coughing up white mucus. Still no fever and I have a pulse oximiter and my oxygen has been bouncing mostly between 98 &amp; 99, but occasionally dropping to 97 - not super worried yet there. Hoping this is the worst of it but preparing for more.",

        "Reddit Post": "An argument I often hear with regards to our path towards herd immunity is that there could be natural immunity on top of vaccinations. And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people. Is there something missing from my logic here? [I have heard that viruses will eventually reach a point of \"peak fitness\"]([url] where it has evolved to optimal survival conditions. Maybe this is what will break the cycle?",

I feel like a horrible mother because I wont let him go, we only go to the parks and those even turn into fights because they want to do more. Please Im not sure what to do at this point, my heart hurts for my children. I have one thats wants to leave but blames me because he has no where to go. And one thats 15 that really just keeps to herself.",

My husband and I are both double vaccinated but our children are not (all under 12). Unfortunately, my husbands grandmother passed away a couple days ago in another province and he is already talking about traveling for the service. We have been super careful through out the pandemic as I have an immune condition so curbside pick up, remote learning and distancing from our family and friends (with the exception of outdoor visits) has been our norm. While my husband would travel alone, this is a BIG change for us. He seems quite comfortable going-me not so much. I'm concerned about the delta variant. I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off on travel until our whole family was vaccinated but that doesn't appear to be an option. Any thoughts?",

I havent eaten at a restaurant, havent seen friends, wear a mask wherever I go, still treat mail as though it can contain virus (even though theres research to show its unlikely to catch COVID from touching a surface). I know that even if I did get COVID, it would be mild since Im vaccinated. Still, I cant help but continue to be anxious, especially with the probably third wave were entering in the US. I feel like on one hand I should loosen up - see vaccinated friends/family, for example - and accept the risk of getting sick with a mild illness. But the other part of me feels like I just dont want to ever get COVID, period. A lot of my friends and family have been giving me a hard time for not seeing them, so I feel like Im just being crazy/paranoid.

Just a background: I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer but these are the circumstances that force me to ask myself this question. I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.",

        "Reddit Post": "Hello. I apologize beforehand for making yet another question about this subject. But I can't seem to find specific information that relates to my particular case... I am a Mexican citizen studying in France. While in France, some months ago I got vaccinated with <ORG>, yet they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December and officially that's how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. Though honestly this left me a bit concerned since not all countries have this policy, as far as I know... I'm back in Mexico for the summer and vaccinations for the youth will begin next week in my city, offering <ORG>, <ORG>, Sputnik V and Sinovac. I'm considering on registering and taking my \"second dose\" here. Specially if it were <ORG> since I've read that mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies. My parents say I shouldn't \"risk it\" since according to France I'm fully vaccinated already. But my girlfriend is immunosupressed and it's always a little scary being close to her since because of my work I am out on the street often and she needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. Can anyone help assessing me on making this choice? Thanks beforehand.",

We were able to make it work because our retired/semi-retired parents were able to take on several days of childcare/week. My spouse and I are both working from home, so the days we didn't have coverage we just made do taking turns watching him and made up for time missed on other days of the week. It wasn't easy but it worked for over a year. He's 3 now. In May, vaccinations were looking good, cases were plummeting, and it seemed like the right time to send him back to school. We toured a preschool that said they had only had a single case of COVID in a student the entire pandemic and everything seemed good safety-wise. Well, he started 3 weeks ago going on a part-time basis 3 days per week. Of course, the numbers have been getting worse and worse. And today we were informed that we had to come pick him up because a classmate of his, who had attended school while symptomatic, tested positive for COVID. The 2nd child to text positive in the last year and a half in the whole school, and it happened in my son's classroom after he had been to school no more than 7 times. I'm devastated. We worked so hard to keep him safe for so long, it feels pointless now. He has no symptoms yet and I hope it stays that way. We will have to get him tested, which will be traumatic, as he has been swabbed before and it's awful. And vaccines for his age group seem so far away, it feels like even if he escapes this time, COVID is looming around the corner waiting for him. We live in a red state where vaccinations have stalled. Just feeling hopeless.",

All the focus has been on survival, and they dont care about quality of life afterwards. Im not sure that I want to survive if I couldnt smell or taste ever again and I had neurological problems and stuff. Meanwhile, all of my vaccinated (I hope/assume) friends have decided that the pandemic is over now, and I feel like I have to choose between protecting my health or everybody moving on without me. Im in improv comedy, and all the theaters are plowing ahead with unmasked performances in little rooms with low ventilation, and a month ago, I would have been excited, but the delta variant (and the gamma, which is also in Chicago for some fucking reason) has changed my risk tolerance. And nobody elses. I dont want to lose my friends and all the wonderful things I got to do from April to last week, but I dont want to lose my health either.",

At the beginning of the year, I've noticed other people I live with don't wash their hands for long enough, definitely nowhere near the advised 20 seconds. This has been becoming a bigger and bigger issue for me recently, as the thought of contaminating myself or my belongings makes me feel stressed and really anxious. It's reached a point where I don't feel safe touching most items in my house without washing my hands right after. I feel like it makes no sense feeling this way, considering there's been very few cases in my town this summer. I wanted to know, is it worth spending as much time as I do trying to keep me and my stuff as clean as possible or should I try going back to a normal way of living, without having to worry so much about everything I touch?",

Ok, so this will be a bit long maybe. So, today our State Goverment announced that they received 134,400 doses of vaccines for the City Metropolitan area, for people of age 30 to 39 (Total population of the urban area: around 5.35 million). However, the issue is: the vaccine the federal goverment is sending is Sinovac (Previously they where sending <ORG> and <PERSON>, and for the teachers they send Cansino). Unfortunately while searching for information, i got the data that the efficiency of Sinovac is barely above 50% And IDK what to think or to do. IMO the best is efficiency above 70% that most vaccines get. This would mean that if i got Sinovac, I will still need to keep isolated for a longer time and i'm getting extremely tired for that. And also the rumors run that Sinovac isn't effective enought against Delta Variant, that seems to be the variant raising here at Mxico. I still don't have the money or the visa to travel USA to get a shot from another brand, i would have done that if i had the resources. But i'm feeling \"tied\" since our freaking federal goverment its handling all at worst. I know that 50% chance is better than 0, but in the long term, not sure how good will be. A friend told me that might be also the chance to get later another vaccine so perhaps get 2 vaccines and might be better, but i'm feeling somehow anxious. The good news is that my family, the ones who worried me more since they are risk population, already got vaccinated with <ORG> and <PERSON>, and even plannig to go overseas once the pandemic stabilize, so it's one thing to worry less. However, now i need to think on myself, but this situation is getting into my head.",

She's been sharing a room with their parents (her sister and her brother in law) and sharing meals with the nephews. The players are tested regularly and last week one of the nephews tested positive. He's asymptomatic. His father and brother have tested negative so far. Sister in law was negative on a rapid test this morning and has a PCR result due tomorrow. If negative, she plans to travel here. She would be hoping to stay in our house with the elderly aunt and uncle and visit my mother in her assisted living home.

I masked up, maintained my distance, and took the vaccine because it's safe and effective and that makes me enough to trust it. May 2021. It was a week after my Vegas trip. Also around when the CDC called on us fully vaccinated people that we can stop masking up if we like. I remembered having a dry throat at first, but I didn't mind it because I was still talking just fine and I wasn't feeling all miserable. I'm not a doctor, but I believe to think that it's much less contagious than even the flu, let alone Covid-19. And then a day or two after that, I had a very runny nose that wouldn't stop. I remembered masking at Fred Meyer, mainly because it was required, but not at the other two. I had no fever, no coughing, no body pain, no sweating, no diarrhea, nothing major. My dad and my brother had it too with no serious symptoms, but I don't recall my mother having it for some reason. Have any of you ever even remembered about masks on sinus infections before 2020? Like....ever? Because a sinus infection is now where NEAR the levels that is Covid and the flu. I'd even mask up for the flu because that's a miserable time. I doubt people will mask up for the flu every single season, though. I just don't expect it all, depending where I live. Am I just ruminating and overthinking this out of the blue?",

I have been exposed plenty of times both before vax and after and never caught it. I have had maybe 20 tests which have all been negative. My brother's wife got it and he still slept in the same bed with her and kissed her and he never got it. He was vaxxed with P plus a booster. Then I have 3 brothers that live at home still. One got it (unvaxxed) but no one else in the house did (everyone unvaxxed except my dad). I don't really get sick often anyways. I am young (24M) and take vitamin D and C everyday. I am starting to think that maybe people like me and certain members of my family may just not be susceptible to covid. I am pretty worried about getting it. The hospital sent out an email yesterday stating it is a matter of \"when\" we will get it not \"if\" (real reassuring). I am hoping I may be right about possibly being immune to it and that it won't come down to \"when\" I will get it. I would like to think I will not and I will certainly still try my best to make sure that I don't.",

Its honestly sickening to me that we still think this wag. Like dont come to work sick but we still expect you to be available at the drop of a hat to be able to answer questions. Like j dont want to look back in a few years and be like maybe if I had tested then, I wouldnt have the health issues I have now. Because on top of this, I have health issues Ive had to miss a lot of work for this year and have nearly drained my PTO. I mean, I just dont get it. Health &gt; work, right? Also, now the entire office knows I am sick with Covid and I keep getting pressed with questions from my coworkers like is it mild because you had your vaccine?? And didnt you already have the flu like 3 times this year? Gah, I just dont know what to do or what to think. My health is nobody elses business in my workplace and now I am just kind of feeling off about the whole thing. Has anyone else felt this way with their work or had to navigate similar issues?",

Although Im glad to finally have that extra boost, the actual experience of getting the shot has left me feeling sort of anxious/upset for the rest of the day, and Id like some insight as to whether Im justified in feeling how I do? Basically, I noticed while getting my booster that the pharmacist administering the shot wasnt wearing gloves. She also kept touching/moving around the needle disposal bin, with her bare hands (which obviously had a lot of used needles inside of it) while giving me my shot. She also moved random furniture in the area around. Idkit just kind of grossed me out that after touching the used needle disposal container and furniture, that she gave me the shot and applied the band-aid? She was also kind of short with me. For example, she asked me if my left arm would work, but when I mentioned that Id rather do my right arm because Im left-handed, she made an exasperated sigh and angrily moved the furniture around so that Id be oriented correctly. This, combined with the fact that she didnt even bother wearing gloves and also kept freely touching the needle disposal bin before applying the band aid makes me wonder if she bothered to follow any health/safety protocols with me while giving me my shot. I have this irrational fear now that Ill HIV/AIDS through cross-contamination too. Anyways, Im wondering if theres anything I should do (like should I shower, go to the doctor, etc.)? Or if my feelings of annoyance and anxiety are justified here? Thanks!",

Im afraid Ill just catch this thing again and that itll be worse. Just now, I went to my local pharmacy to pick up some meds and essentials I needed; I was wearing a mask and my prescription glasses but this girl in front of me coughed a bit every now and then while checking out her purchase. I go over to the cashier and he tells me that girl was paying for a covid test to be done on site. I froze I was behind her and I used the same terminal as her; can i get covid again from this interaction? Im scared again and Im most sure Ill be able to go back to a new normal soon. Do you think I can catch covid again from my pharmacy experience? And also, how can I cope with being forced back to the office?",

However, my spouse only masks up indoor in public and is totally fine not masking at indoor family/friend gatherings. I think this is completely ridiculous and needlessly exposing them to infection (especially since a lot of said gatherings involve those who are not masking anywhere and have unvaccinated kids). Their view is that the social/emotional benefit of these gatherings (mainly because they would involve a shared meal) outweighs their risk of severe disease with a booster. Side note: My spouse is obese and has controlled diabetes. And I think they are making a big mistake. I have given up arguing the topic. I have just started telling them it is their choice, but I will not participate and will be masking around them at home until I know theyre in the clear. And I know masks cant prevent all infections. That is not the main point of my post. Im so frustrated.",

Where on earth do we go from here? My state and our neighbor NY have pretty high vaccination and booster rates, yet we're still getting more cases right now so...now what? Further, I was really hoping to try and pull off going to Japan next year to take the JLPT assessment, but the country just closed their borders to all incoming foreigners for who knows how long.

My biggest fear is that spring 2022 won't be normal at my university (e.g. most classes online, cancelled events, etc) and our administration has been more cautious than most other universities throughout this pandemic. The fact that we won't have more information on the variant for like two weeks just makes it so much worse... Anyways, after being able to get off reddit and avoid covid news for like two months, now my doomscrolling habits are back in full swing. I know it's a situation we can't control, but this just makes it so much worse for me, just sitting here waiting for some shitshow to happen. If things really get bad, I'm afraid it would also make me less optimistic about 2022/2023 as a year ago I remember experts saying by this time we should be pretty much done with this, yet here we are. I just really, really hope that spring 2022 does not turn out to be another semester of lost hopes at my university... Please, I just need some support today after what I've seen, especially that news of how fast cases are rising in South Africa. It's just so hard not knowing what the future will bring, and how this pandemic has gone on for so long with no end in sight, after our predictions on when we'll return to normal have been upended time and time again.",

I'm triple vaxxed now, so when the trailer came out, I told myself I would see this movie opening night no matter what the covid situation looked like. I'm an overly cautious person and I haven't had any fun at all this year. That was before the Omicron variant, which I know does not sound so bad right now, and we won't know for 2-ish weeks what the situation will be, but you know what's also in 2-ish weeks? Spiderman lol. I know I can always refund my ticket if the situation gets really bad, but if I'm boosted and wearing a KN95 mask, do I need to be so worried? I got a seat in the front-most row, so at least I wouldn't be boxed in completely. I know plenty of people go to the movies regularly now, but I also know some people who won't. I don't want to deny myself a fun experience and feel absolutely miserable at home but I also don't want to be stupid. The last time I tried to see a movie two months ago, I refunded the ticket and cried. I was so sad and unsure, I just want to go to the damn movies and have fun. I'm so sick of this. Before anyone suggests, I can't really just wait for a less full showing. I tried that with Black Widow and the theaters just filled up no matter what time I picked. All cinemas are only open now during peak times, so selections are limited, thus everyone packs into the same showing as you. I also live in densely populated LA. Empty theaters are impossible, especially with a movie like this.",

I still haven't been able to get in person mental healthcare because of how expensive it is, and online mental healthcare doesn't work for me. I don't even know if by spring of 2022 we will be done with mask mandates for good or arguing over wether it's smart to go to concerts and stuff like that. Currently I've had no luck finding the right group of people to hang out with post covid, a lot of the groups I used to go to are still online which are social support groups. And I don't do well with zoom calls. Moving isn't even an option for me because of how bad housing prices are everywhere and are only getting worse. And on top of that because of my mental health issues I can't do full time work and only gig work. Then we keep having new variants, maybe this one will turn out not to be a big deal also. Which in turn will make covid restrictions last longer and also the people I know will be less likely to approve of me doing things like going to concerts. And also it will make it even harder for me to get new friends. I don't think life will ever be the same as before the pandemic and it will be worse in many different ways post pandemic",

I am generally very cautious about covid for a variety of reasons but now mostly because my mother is undergoing brain surgery next week and I will be caring for her afterwards and Christmas is coming up where I will (hopefully) be seeing my grandparents and new babies in the family. My whole family is fully vaccinated and most are boostered. My boyfriend lives with his mother who is unvaccinated. I do not go over his house, he comes to mine which I've been okay with since I am not usually around anyone high-risk and he and I are both vaccinated and I have had the booster. He is trying to get an appointment but they are difficult to find. However, with the holidays coming up and my mom's situation I am very wary about even just seeing him before Christmas and it is making me very sad and anxious because I do not know what to do. Thank you for any support",

Counties in and around big cities are more highly vaccinated. I still think these rates are terrible, and as other states get better, the gap becomes more obvious. My own county is doing only slightly worse than the whole state, but our hospitalizations are starting to get critical, and our cases are currently in a small uptick. Deaths remain fairly low, however, which is good. We have several very good hospital systems here, but the ICU usage is not falling as quickly as would be ideal. I have started getting really irritated at the flattening of our vaccinations here, and I'm not sure what I can personally do, if anything. I'm not anyone important. I am risk averse. My social media is basically all people who already believe COVID is real and take precautions and are vaccinated. Everyone is just trying to do the best they can, basically, but I don't see as much frustration among my friends and family. So, I ask, is there anything I can personally do? I'm not a scientist or medical professional. Is there an entity with whom I could donate or volunteer? I just sometimes feel like I'm shouting into the wind, but I really want to do SOMETHING that would help get our rates higher.",

It means the vaccinations are still doing their damn job. Even here in NJ. I'm not writing this to downplay the danger. That is not my intention. But it shows that the more we keep doing what we're doing, we'll end this pandemic. I know there are people who are right now saying \"nothing we do will be good enough to end it.\" Don't go down that path, folks. We are still in much better positions than last year. We have 70% of the population partially vaxxed now, 80% of the 12-up partially vaxxed, and just today we hit 60% fully vaxxed with everyone. Vaccinations are still happening daily as of now consistently over the 1.5 million mark. So even with this new variant, we STILL are going to end this pandemic.",

I've had three people I've matched with talk about getting smashed at bars, going on bar crawls, going to house parties, etc. It just seems like a pattern. I feel like at least in the summer and early spring, there were more masking requirements/mandates and people took it a bit more seriously. Now, I feel ashamed and embarrassed like ***I*** did something wrong by wanting to virtually date a bit before rushing to meet in-person and wanting a potential date to avoid high-transmission areas for at least 5 days prior to us meeting. It's pissing me off that it's being skewed like *I'm* a paranoid nutter when there's literally a new variant raging across half the world. You would think MORE people would be alert and vigilant now, but all of these people seem completely unbothered *(???).* I'm also exhausted and emotionally broken and so, so lonely.

I had to cancel my Christmas last year as the UK went into a lockdown over-Christmas, and I will be dammed if the same thing happens again this year. Furthermore, I did have a look at the figures myself [[url] and deaths and hospitalizations are steadily falling which shows that the vaccines are working and that fills me with some confidence that we will have a normal Christmas this year, as going by the data there is no need for a lockdown AT THIS STAGE! After Christmas, they can do what they like! &amp;#x200B; One thing I hate about this Covid situation is how the media are reporting information. It's got to the point where I read the data myself and I don't bother watching the news or reading anything online. The media likes to focus on the high-case numbers here, but every-time they fail to mention that the deaths and hospitalizations have been falling for a number of weeks now. Part of me thinks they love to whip people up into a state of hysteria, even though at the moment there is no need. I get that people need to be informed about these things, I'm not at all suggesting people should just ignore what's happening, but I do think there needs to be better reporting from the media as they love the sensationalism of all this, at the end of the day they make money out of it don't they.",

Needed dental work during pregnancy, but decided to wait until after baby was born because I prefer to take all the dental drugs. Decided not to go to dentist during COVID. Got got my second <ORG> shot on April 29, 2021. Dull pain in molar started yesterday. I'm scheduled for my booster on Friday. I originally wanted to wait until 2 weeks after the booster, but now I'm considering going sooner. I have a non-vaccinated 20 month old, so I'm nervous. Is it safe to get a potential root canal right now??",

        "Reddit Post": "I just wanted to share my positive personal experience to help encourage people to get their booster shots. I got two shots of <ORG> in March and had zero symptoms from either shot. Hurray! I qualified recently for the booster and decided to get it before traveling for Thanksgiving. I got a shot of <ORG> to mix things up a bit, and it was exactly two weeks from when I got the shot to when I was exposed to COVID. The shot itself I didnt even feel, and the symptoms I had the next day were fatigue, fever, and some body aches that I could treat with some Tylenol and rest. I was 100% back to normal the day after that! My boyfriend and I got exposed to COVID over thanksgiving from an unvaccinated family member. He hadnt qualified for a booster yet, and has been sick since Wednesday. A mild case for sure, but still symptomatic. We live in a tiny apartment and spend almost all of our time together. Since he got his booster the same day his symptoms started, we didnt realize it was COVID right away, so I wasnt distanced for a couple of days. Its been almost a full week that hes been symptomatic and I have consistently tested negative and have zero symptoms. Boosters work! Theyre important to getting everything under control.",

I live with three others (all who work with the public, one who works in healthcare) and our current house rules are the following: * All guests must have a negative Covid-19 tests the week they want to visit (even if they are vaccinated) * If guests do not want to get tested/ don't have time to get tested, they must wear a mask inside our house * If a housemate travels, they must wear a mask inside the house for three days and get a Covid-19 test the 3rd day * If a housemate goes to a restaurant, or party, they must wear a mask inside the house for three days and get a Covid-19 test the 3rd day * A rapid Covid-19 test is not permitted to be used in lieu of a gov't Covid-19 test, or in lieu of waiting 3 days * Appointments such as hair cuts, doctors visits, or dentists visits do not require a Covid-19 test Is this too much to ask? I don't mind because I don't go out often, but I feel it might be a bit... **much.** To be fair to my housemates, they have friends who are immunocompromised or have had a organ transplant. And another housemate caught the Delta variant after traveling but recovered after four days. Lastly, one of my housemates works in a place where they don't get days off if they get Covid-19... but I feel since we live in a high population of vaccinated people, we would be okay? Is there any news articles or studies that I can show them in order to calm down the frequency of testing? What do you all think?",

I kept wavering about it before, but the more I hear, the more I know I'm making the right decision. I told my husband that he is free to take the other members of our family, but my two year old and I will not be going. This trip would require 6 of us to be in a car together for 13+ hours each way, plus 4 of us would stay in a hotel (husband, me, 6 year old, and 2 year old) and 2 would stay with his parents (my stepkids - in high school and in college) for one week. Everyone else in my household besides the little one is vaccinated. The 6 year old will be fully vaccinated soon, and everyone else except high schooler will be boosted. My husband told me he cannot stop his son, the high schooler, from going to a party full of unmasked teenagers prior to our trip. Although I can control the actions of my little kids to help mitigate risk (like always wearing masks), I have no control over the older ones, so I'd be forcing my little kids to contract whatever their siblings have during the long drives. Even if it isn't Covid, any cold-like symptom will force us to reconsider our plans, so I'd rather just nix it now. Unfortunately, for the rest of them, it means that no one is going, since my husband doesn't want to make the drive himself. My husband and I have decided that we'll visit when the little one can get vaccinated and when the weather is nicer and we can do more outdoor activities with extended family.",

Through the weekend that got worse and on Sunday night (Nov 28th) is when the coughing started. I've had a pretty bad cough since then which has started to subside since this past Sunday (Dec 5th). I got tested on Monday (Nov 29th) and the result was negative but it was a rapid test which I know are inaccurate. I was not feeling any better on Thursday (Dec 2nd) so I decided to go into an urgent care thinking it was probably some kind of infection where they tested me for COVID again and it was positive. The nurse practitioner had given me a return to work date of today (Dec 7th), but I still decided to stay home since I woke up with a pretty bad coughing fit. The day has been pretty calm with a few small coughing fits here and there. I am seeking advice on when it would be safe to return to work, thank you everyone!",

I have pretty bad anxiety but have managed it pretty well this whole time despite some scares. Today I had a guy cough on me at work as I passed him in the hall way without him wearing a mask. Later that day I was squeezing past someone in a tight hall way because I was in a hurry and I felt them exhale on the back of my head, their breath smelled awful. They were wearing a mask, but I can not understand how I could have felt that gust of wind/smelt that if it was functioning properly. Later that day I was in a very large room and the person took of their mask to give a 15 minutes speech. I tend to stay home and never interact with anyone outside of my family. I allways wear my mask in public places. I read online that the <ORG> protects people from 2 to 8 months aside from having covid. I am hoping if I get positive that I can get monoclonal anti bodies again. I have heard in my state that cases are rising again, and I can see why because people do not take it very seriously in my culture. What do you think of my experiences today as far as exposure? thanks",

I texted my friend the good news and that I was excited to be able to see people again. She admitted that she is not planning to get her kids vaccinated and now Im second guessing myself. Shes always been a bit crunchier than me, but her kids have always gotten their shots before. I really want to start visiting with people, and the plan was to wait until our kid could get her shot then start slowly visiting people, but I had (very wrongly) assumed that those people would also be vaccinated. We live with my in-laws, both in their late 70s, who will not get vaccinated either. It feels like its just us in our little bubble and everyone else around is not getting their kids or selves vaccinated. Its hard to feel confident in the choice, ya know? If we did make a plan to visit my friend (both adults vaccinated but not their kids) would that be a huge risk? Do we risk bringing it home if we are vaccinated? I dont want to go another two years without seeing anyone; I dont know that my mental health could handle that. But how do you trade mental health for the potential of real, long lasting health issues from catching it? I appreciate any support. Thanks!",

I feel really afraid of my upcoming 10 day mandatory quarantine in a hotel for my trip. I'm not allowed to leave the room (not even for 30 minutes) due to government regulations and the police are watching, and the thought of staying in a room for 10 days really scares me. I'm a very outdoor person. Even in winter snowing I still managed to get out of the house to walk around during the previous lockdown in my country. Even during the first lockdown I get out of my apartment everyday just to get a fresh air, even if only for 15 minutes. I think another cause of my fear is because I'm afraid of giving up on temptation to snack and thus overeat. Anyone can give me a perspective on how I can see this quarantine from a more positive light? Or activities that can help me pass the time without thinking about food? I was thinking about working but my employer does not allow remote work from another country .",

I'm afraid my brother will be pissed that we're being such ninnies. He just texted me asking if we're coming so I can't put this off. Any thoughts/suggestions?",

Shes an extremely cautious individual and only hangs out with fully vaccinated people. Im literally only going to be in her city for one day and we havent seen each other in years so we made plans to be together all day, mostly walking around outside but will be driving in the same car together for some of the time. I talked to her today and she wasnt planning on getting tested before traveling home as she recently got the booster, wears her mask and it isnt required to get tested before domestic travel. She will be getting tested 5 days after flying, but unfortunately for me, thats one day after we will get together. What are the chances she pass anything to me if she gets infected on her flight or before? Do we think/know the booster protects against transmission or most infection in the first place? I will be flying to another country a few days after we meet up and I dont want to risk testing positive before my flight but I also really dont want to be annoying and ask her to get tested because shes literally the most covid cautious person I know (before getting vaccinated she didnt leave her house for ANYTHING except when she was walking outside with a mask on). Any thoughts? Am i overreacting?",

My mother had osteoarthritis of the knees since about 8 years. She also has a bunion in one of her feet. Along with osteoarthritis she has osteopenia and pain in other joints. We checked for rheumatic markers but none were found. Anyways, all these osteopenia, osteaoarthritis of the knee, the pain with the other joints worsened gradually over time over the years. However the sharpest decline was in the 12 months after she had COVID-19. She had COVID-19 in October 2020. And the x-ray reports in March 2021 and December 2021 has seen very sharp worsening of the severity of the osteoarthritis of the knee. Doctors have also mentioned that the osteopenia and pain in other joints and the bunion seem to have worsened as well based on the symptoms. So my question is: Is this a coincidence? Or does COVID-19 indeed worsen, osteoarthritis, osteopenia and bunions? Second question: If COVID-19 does worsen these bone conditions, what's the underlying mechanism?",

My whole family is fully vaccinated and I havent seen them in nearly two years because of this. Just before Omicron, I finally thought it safe to spend a good month home and take a break from this state and partners family (We have plans to move to a better place but finally impossible at the moment).

We're planning to fly across the country in about 10 days to see my parents for Christmas and I have really been looking forward to it. My husband's brother is a pulmonary intensive care doctor at a hospital in MA, so he's been treating COVID right from the start. We were chatting with him last night and he told us there is a doctor in his hospital, at least double-vaxxed and only 59 years old, who has COVID and is on life support. I don't know anything else about this guy or his case (don't know about any comorbidities, don't even know if he was boosted) but this story really fucked me up and I can feel my anxiety spiking in a major way.

The drive to increase booster roll-out is more to do with the increased number of cases and the fact that vaccine efficacy drops off over time anyway, not that omicron is 'evading' the current vaccines more than other variants. \\- The media will always jump to worst case scenarios because bad news sells more than good news. Don't take any headline at face value without checking with a more reliable source first.",

My husband and I were meant to go back to the UK from Europe to visit family for New Year. But then our flights got cancelled in January because the airline pulled all flights on that route for the entire month. Then if we arranged for a few days earlier we would need to get pre-depature PCR tests on Christmas Day itself which seems grim. If we went earlier, like next week, our boosters would not have kicked in. And there could be a lockdown or travel bans/quarantines coming in any day between now and when we would return. It is all round not a great idea with Omicron because me and my in-laws are all high risk. So we are going to cancel but I feel dreadfully guilty. I know they will be very disappointed although they'll understand. Also some of my colleagues are still going to the UK and I feel maybe we didn't try hard enough. Just wondered if anyone else is dealing with this?",

Im afraid that the people working on me can still transmit something to me (for example, if the makeup artist is really close to my face while applying my lipstick, Im not sure how safe Id be). Because I also live with family members, I worry that Ill also be endangering them.

I got the booster shot back in late October (<ORG> x3). My entire family is boosted, and I live in CA where most of the people in my community are fully vaxxed/boosted. I have gotten back into socializing and even attending large events (for example, I went to a small indoor concert with about \\~100 people unmasked, but all of whom vaxxed in order to get in). I am very careful about where I go and who I have direct contact with, but have been relieved since most of the people close to me are boosted, let alone fully vaxxed. My issue is that I have a close friend (who lives/goes to school in AZ), who is **unvaccinated** and will not be getting it. She naturally got covid in late august of this year. It was bound to happen since she is basically clubbing/partying every night over there, and since there aren't any mask/vaccine mandates in AZ, most of everyone in her institution got it. She is visiting CA and wants for us to make plans for a new year's party together (with some of my friends here who are vaxxed/boosted). I am uncomfortable bringing her not only around myself, but around people who have taken precautions like I have to be safe (her reasons for not getting it are incredibly stupid and I don't want to get into it). I initially said yes (since I figured it's safe since I'm boosted), but I am having second thoughts now. This is because it's been 4 months since she got it naturally and studies show that natural immunity wanes quicker than the vaccines and transmission for unvaccinated individuals are much higher compares to vaccinated people. I understand that the risk for her to get sick again is higher than the risk of me getting sick, but it's not impossible. &amp;#x200B; What would you do if you were in my shoes?",

I know it doesn't look like that now, but giving up and despairing/making assumptions that the next year will be bad... don't go down that path, guys. It's toxic and unhealthy. Things are still MUCH better than they were last year. And they will continue to get better. Don't assume that 2022 will be a repeat of 2021 or listen to people who tell you that it will be.

New variants that may kill me next week keep appearing, the word \"pandemic\" is practically taboo in my house, I may not get to see my grandma for christmas, and my little sister lost her graduation ball due to not being vaccinated. When will this end? Seriously, does anyone have hope for 2022 anymore? This feels eternal. Vaccine passports and mandates also do not help, only restraining my life and provoking angry reactions from my parents, which worsens my mental health. Will they ever be gone, the mandates and passports? I feel trapped. I swear, I'm making every effort I can, but this situation is way, way beyond me. I feel like giving up already. I need hope.

As I didn't wear a mask at all (but still had one on my person in case I was directed by staff/volunteers to put one on for any reason), I was concerned I'd feel unwelcome or be treated with hostility because of the possibility that attendees who masked would kick up a fuss in-person about those who didn't, official government advice be damned. These concerns popped up following a discussion someone brought up in a Facebook group I'm in about the consensus on masking for the event. To be clear, I'm not an anti-masker and I, at a minimum, affirm that each and every individual has their own personal boundaries when it comes to their approach on tackling the current pandemic situation. Since a certain point of the pandemic, I personally only mask in places and situations where they're enforced (e.g. public transport, health care settings), and have my face uncovered everywhere else. Has anyone else here had similar feelings not too long ago? Concerns aside, I enjoyed my weekend and it felt great to have in-person conventions again after half a year of nothing",

Not sure if this is due to stress thinking about our flight coz we've been cancelled many time now and I've been thinking we might not be able to come home again, seems like everything is going bad these past few days. Or if I might really be positive. I will have my test on Thursday and I will know the results on Friday. I'm just really worried since I've been reading that omicron has very mild symptoms.",

        "Reddit Post": "Hey guys, so for those of you who don't know, Cornell University just went remote due to a Covid outbreak with hundreds of cases and much of it is suspected to be Omicron. Just looking at the situation over there, it's making me fear the same could happen at my university. My university has been very restrictive throughout 2020-2021, but seems to have changed stance coming into this semester accepting Covid is something we have to learn to coexist with. I think the reason Cornell discovered such an outbreak is because of their surveillance testing. We don't have surveillance testing here, and one could say that's bad, but I think this helped us avert something similar this semester. My university is huge, so if we had similar testing as Cornell, I'm afraid we'd have detected a similar outbreak and gone remote. I looked through the Cornell subreddit, and it just seems like they're in shambles right now. I honestly feel bad for Cornell students right now after having yet another semester upended by Covid, and who knows about Spring 2022. Even worse, I now have an ominous feeling that the shitshow at Cornell will soon come to my university and we'd see the same thing happen. Is this a preview of what's to come at my university? Is this a preview of the damage Omicron can do? I saw that the Cornell president sent out an email saying why even if a variant is more mild, if it's more transmissible the impact will be more serious, using this to defend the university's decision to close down. Their libraries are closed, dining halls are closed, and exams are moved online. It's the exact kind of nightmarish scenario that I wish would never happen at my university this year. Please don't let my university be next...",

We have like 90% of Canadians vaccinated, but the 10% that are not are ruining things for everyone. Our hospital capacity was terrible before covid, and now it feels like its just always on the brink of being overwhelmed. You would think that in the past 2 years, our government would focus on increasing our hospital capacity and retaining HCWs.. but they havent. At all. So now with any sort of threat of a new wave, we have to lockdown and implement a bunch of restrictions. They are making an announcement tomorrow regarding increasing travel restrictions. This is causing me to spiral for two reasons. 1) I have really bad seasonal depression. I prioritize winter vacations every year and the thought of being stuck in Canada for another winter is unbearable. Because Im an essential worker, if they reinforce a quarantine, that takes away my ability to go on vacation. Meanwhile, I think HCWs and other essential workers need a vacation the most. Not to discredit people who WFH, because I know it can be super draining, but at least you can travel whenever because the quarantine doesnt effect your job. 2) My partner is American. Rumour has it that they are going to ban any non-citizens from entering the country. My partner can WFH so we have relied on his flexibility to be able to see each other. I just cant be separated from him indefinitely again. We were separated for 6+ months last year with no end in sight. Ive never been more depressed. I dont even know what I want out of this post but I just had to type it out because I feel like screaming. If this is how life is going to be every winter, I dont think I want to live it anymore.",

The whole house was sick. I live with my husband, boyfriend, and kid. I was out of town on working so on 12/3 my mom checked in on the kiddo since she is also a nurse. Didn't wear a mask around her. I'm a travel nurse so when my set days off were nearly over I was sick so I got a test so I could go back to work and rapid tested positive 12/6. Mom tested rapid negative 12/7. Friend T who hung out with us literally every day until 11/29 tested negative PCR 12/9. Boyfriend got quite a bit worse over the week so on 12/13 we sent him to a doctor to get covid meds and he tested PCR covid negative. Husband got tested today since his work wanted him to wait and is awaiting PCR results that we won't have for 3+ days. I just found out that my roommate's son in the city I work in is covid home test positive as of today symptoms since Friday. Yesterday was my last day of quarantine so I'm supposed to drive up there Thursday to go to work Friday. We share a bathroom. So what's the issue? I'm terrified that my positive rapid was a false positive, but I don't want to waste nearly $1000 next week renting an Airbnb if I was positive and can't get infected again since I literally had it less than a week ago. So options. 1. Screw it just get an Airbnb. 2. Screw it just stay there. 3. Get a home test. If I'm positive stay if I'm negative get an Airbnb. What would you do or is there something I'm missing???",

I just wonder if this pandemic is going to end next year, how would we know? I mean, I know we've seen a lot've predictions like <PERSON> say the pandemic might end in Spring 2022, if we're lucky. I also heard right now we're in the 72% of vaccination rate here in the U.S. Although the state I live in is now in 80% for single dose which is not bad. But, what if next year is still the same as this year? Yes, the pandemic will end, of course it will, but I'm not so sure it' end the pandemic next year. I was expecting this pandemic to end this year until the Delta Variant came in and I was very disappointed and starting to like 2021 than I hate 2020. And I do I have feeling I might be disappointed if the pandemic ends next year has failed like this year. I hope I'm wrong and I'll try to hang in there. I'm worried that maybe next year might be a disappointment as this year. But, again, I hope I'm wrong.",

Im in university and we actually never went back in person in the fall and they are promising us an in person semester in the winter, but I dont know what to believe anymore. I feel like I wasted my money on a degree that was useless with online learning. I feel like I got nothing out of school.

But just the depressing, bleak outlook still gets to me. Also, even if my family is free of COVID, no one can escape the toll its had on the economy and the fear of whats to come for the economy. Also, though we havent had COVID, we have had just about everything else in my household. Since June 1st, weve experienced hand foot and mouth disease, upper respiratory infections, RSV (almost put my infant in the ER), whatever caused everyone but me to puke their guts out in the middle of the night but wake up fine the next day (happened at 3 different times between my wife and kids), and whatever unidentified shit I caught in late November that gave me a sore throat with the worst pain Ive ever experienced outside of broke bones. I still have a lingering sore throat that wont go the fuck away. Ive lost my taste and smell for the third time in as many months, despite still not getting COVID. Right now, my fear isnt COVID itself, but its effect on the economy and mental health. Im on a long waitlist to see a therapist because despite having a good life. Also, mental health facilities having a waitlist doesnt seem like a good sign. Anyway, anyone that feels hopeless, here is an article that shows we are not alone. It was strangely comforting to me .

        "Reddit Post": "I wanted to share my viewpoints on Covid after having it. I had a breakthrough infection at the end of October and while I recovered at home, it wasnt fun at all and took me about two weeks to feel fully recovered. Im double vaxxed and am about to get my booster soon. I gotta say, Im significantly less worried about COVID than I was before. At a certain point I needed to get over my anxiety of getting this disease and getting it is what finally caused me to experienced a sense of relief. After getting my booster, I see absolutely to no reason at all to be worried about this. Sure, Ill continue to wear my mask when required. Sure, if I feel sick Ill stay away from people. In my mind tho, the pandemic is done for me. I dont have the mental bandwidth to keep worrying about this.",

Im still freaking out tho cuz there were a couple of times where the waiter was unmasked and standing a little too close to me while taking my order. There was also a small group of unmasked men sitting directly behind me (with not much space between our backs) who were relentlessly flirting with an unmasked waitress for liketen minutes straight (it was kind of annoying to listen to). So with all that laughing and talking Im worried that something couldve spread to me even though my back was facing the groups back, How much risk am I in? Im freaking out.",

My brother asked me to quarantine for a week before going home or else he wont go. He doesnt live with our parents either and hes anti-covid vaccine so hes not vaccinated. Hes been very paranoid about catching covid that he barely leaves his house. My mom is fully vaccinated and my dad is also an anti-vaxer so he is not vaccinated. My parents want me to come regardless of if I quarantine or not, but they asked if I could quarantine for the sake of my brother so we could all be together. I love my family and I wouldnt want to jeopardize their health, but I dont think its fair that I need to quarantine a whole week. Ive done my part by getting the vaccine. I take precautions when I go out like wearing a mask, etc and its not like Im going to crowded areas. Ill also get tested before I go home. I have some last minute shopping to do and if decide to go, then Im selfish for not wanting to quarantine and I dont care if I get my family sick according to my brother. How would you all handle this? Would you quarantine for the sake of your family or do you think its unfair?",

        "Reddit Post": "So long story. Me and my family are vaccinated other than my children, and me and my wife were actively discussing their vaccines. We have 3 girls aged 12-10-5. They stayed for 2 days at my sisters house while we did some Christmas shopping this weekend. Sister and her husband are fully vaccinated also. Sister calls Sunday evening to tell me that her husband can't smell or taste. I immediately go get the kids and bring them home. They get tested. She's negative he's positive like we assumed. Monday night the 2 older kids start coughing with no fever. Tuesday they feel like crap so I go get some rapid tests from Walmart. Sure enough they're positive. The 5 year old is completely fine. No symptoms and negative test. As with me and my wife. Right now the 10 year old is getting hit the hardest with fever. We've been rotating Tylenol and motrin every 3 to 4 hours per her pediatrician and she's still coughing quite a bit and saying her belly is hurting some. Same with the 12 year old but her fever is only a low grade one. They're really good kids and decided it would be best if they quarantined to their room and wore a mask when they had to come out so they don't get their little sister sick. I've struggled this entire pandemic to keep their lives as normal as possible while still trying to keep them safe and I'm feeling like a massive failure right now. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that they're going to be fine. Like I know that they will it's just hard to keep my mind from racing. I'm also worried that the little one is going to get it or their mom and me even though we're fully vaccinated. Just wanting some similar stories with good outcomes maybe? And the time line to expect with this fever? I'm not sure why the fever is scaring me so bad that they have. Idk. I'm a \"man\" so it's hard to talk to any of my friends about it and it's easier to get on here and vent to strangers. Sorry for the long post.",

I've been staying home through most of Covidworking from home, very little to no socializing with anyone outside of my familybut I went out tonight to a fairly empty bar (with vaccine mandates + masking when you're not at your seat) to say goodbye to a coworker who is moving to another job. I really had to go to the bathroom and rushed off, in the process completely forgetting to put on my mask between going to the table to the restroom. There were two other people in there (masked), and I was completely maskless. I feel like such an idiot putting myself at risk like that. I'm convinced I'm going to contract the Omicron variant from my stupid mistake, and it just doesn't feel like it was worth it. I'm going to do a rapid test tomorrow or the following day, but I can't shake this upset. Running to the washroom while drinking in a bar has never felt so fraught before. Should I be deeply worried about what happened? Am I overreacting? And will going out ever feel normal again?",
