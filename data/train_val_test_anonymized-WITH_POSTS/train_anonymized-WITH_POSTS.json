        "Reddit Post": "Im suppose to get my first vaccination soon. Everyone else in my household and my mother is fully vaccinated. After doing a lot of research to questions I had regarding the vaccines I felt more comfortable finally booking to get one. It seemed like they are/were working. Lockdowns were being lifted, I saw online people doing things social and doctors celebrating etc. I avoid the news about covid for my mental health. Pretty much what I find out about the pandemic pops up on my feed. Now Im seeing so much conflicting information at the same time and Im confused and defeated. UK says pfizer vaccine is 88% effective against delta variant but is that only against hospitalizations? What about actually getting it and suffering? Israel says pfizer went from 64% to 39% . This may not be helpful but Ive recently read about a lot of people on reddit who are fully vaccinated getting covid - and what concerns me more is a lot of them are saying its kicking their ass. Why are they making it seem like on the news and in research that getting covid after vaccinated IF YOU DO is mild like sniffles? This is extremely concerning and Im feeling very discouraged and hopeless about this situation. I miss my family. So much has changed in my life since the pandemic started and I still dont see it going away any time soon. Even after Im vaccinated I still have to worry !? This truly fucking sucks.",

        "Reddit Post": "Hi. My mom is already fully vaccinated (with Sinovac,) and it's already her fifth day of experiencing symptoms. However, so far, her symptoms are mild. First two days: Cold Third day: Dry cough Fourth day: Mild dry cough Fifth day: Mild dry cough and mild cold In our country, there are only few people with the Delta variant - around 120. She hasn't experienced her loss of taste and smell, which brings me to wonder - is it possible she has the Delta variant, or is it also normal that she still has her taste and smell? I've googled online, but they're just saying that not losing your sense of taste and smell means your symptoms are more severe, which I fear, but highly doubt. Her symptoms so far are relatively mild so far, but of course, only time will tell. Apologies if I seem like I'm rambling. I'm only 16 and extremely worried. I know she's already vaccinated, but it would still be great to hear everyone's much-needed advice.",

Havent been to a bar, restaurant, nothing. Very few social gatherings but theyve been outdoors. I returned to work first week of June 2021 upon my boss request since I was vaccinated. I was all for it as I needed a normal schedule back in my life quarantine schedule was literally killing me I think. Now while neither of my bosses have taken this super seriously, my one boss is at least vaccinated. My other boss isnt. He got Covid once before and now was apparently exposed to it at some point last week when he played golf with his uncle (who runs our corporate office one town over). His uncle has Covid-19 fully. Unaware of his vaxx status. Anyway, I found this out through back channels and context clues. My actual two bosses did not disclose this to me. The one that was exposed (likely this past Thursday) I have not seen in person since Wednesday. However, he was in the office Friday while I was not. The one that was exposed is working from home today and the next several. Has anyone else encountered this type of situation and if so what did you do? My sanity doesnt want me to work from home again but my fear and anxiety are slowly taking back over. Any suggestions on what to do? For reference, by the way, our branch is a very small group. Today for example there are only 3 people here including me and we all have our own closed door offices. I only share a bathroom with one other person who is fully vaxxed.",

The kit arrived, I did the test and posted it last Tuesday. I threw the packaging etc away. As I hadn't had my result by email I went online yesterday to find they needed a barcode number and <ORG> reference to register to get my result. They've got my email address and sent me an order number so they know where to send the result. I called them and asked them for the barcode of the kit they sent me and the <ORG> reference and they said they can't give it to me and I'll have to do another test as they won't give me the results unless I have those numbers. Seems ridiculous to me that they have the information but won't tell me my result and now I may have isolated for longer than necessary for no good reason. Has anyone else had this problem?

Heres some takeaways from it: As you can see, new cases have risen only modestly among people over 65, suggesting that breakthrough infections are rare. I think people who are vaccinated are not, on a population level, major contributors to the transmission of the disease, Dr. David Dowdy, a Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist, told me What is clear is that people who are vaccinated and have symptomatic breakthrough infections can transmit it to other people, Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University said. What is not at all clear is whether vaccinated asymptomatic people can transmit it. And my best guess is no or not very often. He added: Im not worried about an asymptomatic vaccinated person spreading it to me. Its also important that the country not respond in ways that would do more harm than good say, by delaying the full reopening of schools, Dowdy added. For vaccinated people, Covid still represents a very small risk, and the cost of our response should not exceed the benefits. I hope this helps somebodyit surely helped me.",

        "Reddit Post": "I'm really struggling mentally with the Delta resurgence. That feels better to say that.... 6 months ago we decided to rent a house (VRBO) at the beach for a getaway. There's no boardwalk and the beach isn't packed. It's a family atmosphere. It's just me and my wife and 2 kids. My wife and I are fully vaccinated. 1 kid just got the 2nd shot and the other is too young to get vaccinated. We aren't planning any activities beyond sitting on the beach and enjoying time away from home. We still aren't dining in at restaurants and we wear masks indoors. I'm not too concerned about the beach since it is outdoors and we can maintain more than 6' of distance from everyone. I can't shake a fear about the rental house. I don't know who was in it before us. In theory, they are leaving at 11am, a cleaning crew will come in, then we can arrive at 4. That's a lot of presumably unmasked people in a space that I'm about to inhabit. It's probably irrational, but I don't want to sit on the couch, or use dishes, etc... I'm scared of the air conditioning. I know that sounds silly. We are planning to wash the sheets and towels when we get there since 1 kid is allergic to a few detergents. I see the numbers, usually a percentage, and I don't understand them. It's hard for me to interpret. I never see it as odds like 1 out of every so many people will get delta. I know a few people that are vaccinated that still got Delta, I read about it every day. I don't really understand what the chances are that we catch it. I really want to relax in the house, but I am freaked out. I've spent 18 months in a bubble in my house and I don't know how to get out of it. I know this seems silly. I'm embarrassed to feel this way. I want to get away and create fun memories with my wife and kids. What are the real risks of the rental house and what can I do to mitigate them?",

There's a few more articles on this, which I'll link below, but seeing this really helped me feel better today. In recent days I've been getting really worried that Delta would lead to my school once again cancelling in-person classes/activities for the fall, given how restrictive they've been throughout the pandemic. However, if this were true, it would mean that this current surge in the US peaks around mid-August, significantly sooner than the September/October peak I've heard previously, and would mean that the worst will be behind us by the time the fall semester starts. I think this is definitely a good sign for the US. Here's some other articles on this: [[url] [[url]",

Another big reason is the surge in other viruses. Since we were all wearing masks for so long, there is a crazy unexpected surge in viruses that were more or less dormant while masked up. We sent our toddler to part time daycare in early June and he almost immediately got an upper respiratory infection. After he recovered, we sent him back and he got hand foot and mouth disease. After he recovered from that, he got RSV, which my whole family, including my infant, now has. We were on the verge of taking my infant to the hospital yesterday because he keeps throwing up, but are monitoring him at home per doctors advice. They said because of everyone being masked up for so long its just hitting everyone hard right now. Anyway, mask mandates will protect the selfish unvaccinated by choice crowd from COVID, but the rest of us who chose to get vaccinated so we can go maskless cant build up our immune systems, and end up catching everything else when we take our masks off. I know there are people who cant get vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated by choice. The idea of another masked up winter and virus-ridden 2022 summer is awful to me.",

Also I feel like this pandemic has become a authoritarian capitalist scam by the 1% elites to gain more wealth and power from the crisis (which is contributing to my anger (since I hate abuse of power) Sorry if this is long and feels more like a rant but I feel like I have to get this off my chest somewhere",

And now I feel like I'm spreading COVID-19 to my parents, despite myself getting vaccinated against it. Like, I know the best I'm going to experience is mild symptoms anytime I *do* get it, plus my parents are vaccinated as well, so either they'll experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all any time I spread it to them. But COVID-19 has the potential to mutate and thus evade our immune systems much more easily. And with that many unvaccinated people spreading it among each other for the sake of their otherwise nonexistent \"freedoms\", it's going to mutate and infect all of us vaccinated people and kill us all. So is there anyone who will help me with this? Thanks!",

I dont trust the CDC, I dont trust <PERSON>, and I especially dont trust political figures (not that I ever trusted them). I was a big advocate for the CDC and <PERSON>, but now that you can read something where they say we need to go back to masking even the vaccinated, while in the same breath say vaccines are extremely effective, I feel like I cant trust what they say. The two ideas contradict themselves and Im tired of trying to figure out whats true and whats BS. All I know is I was wearing a mask before I was vaccinated and felt depressed and hopeless. I got the vaccine as soon as I was able to and was soon able to take my mask off, which made things feel a lot better. Now, I will soon be forced to put the mask back on. Is my vaccine not effective? If Im vaccinated and still have to wear a mask is that going to always be the case? The voices I once trusted seem to have more flip flops than a Shoe Carnival in Myrtle Beach. People keep saying this will soon be over, but how? Vaccines rates have hit a wall, variants are popping up like pimples on middle schooler, and we seem hellbent on protecting half the country that chooses not to protect themselves.

I live a little outside the city, and at this point, like.. should I tell her we cant go?

Its just stressing me out scrolling through this subreddit looking for some bit of reassurance and seeing everyone making each other feel better because theyre vaccinated and breakthrough cases are low, so fuck everyone who cant do it, theres no hope for you.

From the numbers I have seen, it's somewhere around 1 in 20 young people who get COVID, will get \"long covid\". I've been vaccinated, AstroZeneca, two doses (I got it earlier than most young people, first does in March). However from the numbers I have seen, the AZ vaccine only has about 60-80% effectiveness, which is pretty high I guess but still leaves you a 1/4 chance of not being immune. Also I have read that being stressed can have a impact of how well vaccines work, and I have been very stressed for a long time now. I figure that, going to Uni, I'm going to be living in a flat with 4 other people, most young people don't seem to take COVID very seriously, so it's not that unlikely one of my flatmates gets it and then I get exposed to it at some point. Also pretty sure stress can further increase your chances of getting some lingering effects from covid, especially as I have been worried about stuff like brain fog in the past. I feel like if I get covid at all I'm going to end up with it, purely through psychosomatic symptoms at this point. Is there anything I am missing here that makes this something i need not worry about?",

I believe I saw the first posts about a \"pneumonia\" spreading through China on Reddit around that time and there was a sinking feeling in my stomach. For the first year of the pandemic me and my household were vigilant against the virus, none of us became infected, and in March myself, my partner, and my parents all got vaccinated. But I only got the first dose. Two days after I got the first dose of the vaccine I noticed that I started having petechiae rashes pop up, which terrified me. Since then I've had bloodwork done by my doctors, seen dermatologists, and had my anxiety increase tenfold. I've started seeing a therapist about this, and other things, and I'm set to see a hematologist at the end of August, but I'm still without a second dose and gripped with fear that I'll catch the delta variant and that it will hospitalize me or worse. I feel like I am slowly losing my mind, I don't feel like I'm the same person that I once was, and I feel like it's straining my relationship with my partner, with my family, and with my friends. I'm 28, overweight, addicted to nicotine and weed, but other than that moderately healthy (I've never had any other health issues), but from the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out at night there's this huge anxiety cloud over my head that this will end up being my demise. I want nothing more than for everything to check out okay and get my second dose and be protected but I feel like I'm living in a state of constant fear and it's tearing me apart.",

Now, they are required at all times indoors for the fully vaccinated, except when eating or drinking, in your dorm room, etc. My question is why is this necessary if over 96% of the people on campus will be fully vaccinated?

My great uncle had to go to the hospital and he couldnt be discharged until they found a way for him to have oxygen at home. If he wasnt vaccinated he more than likely wouldnt have made it. That was really close to home. Then I saw the map of counties from red to orange to yellow to blue.

Now it looks like that opportunity is being taken from all of us thanks to people not getting vaccinated, and the city my college is in has now passed a mask mandate for all indoor places (public and private) that Im really worried will be the beginning of a return of mostly virtual classes, social distancing, and restrictions on gathering with others during my last year of college before moving away from everyone after I graduate.

Everyone will be vaccinated which is what was giving me peace of mind before all this news about the delta variant came out, but now I feel unsure again.

Last year we were waiting for vaccines so those who didn't want to take any chances with this virus could get vaccinated. However now so many people clearly don't want the vaccines and everybody who wanted one already got one. My understanding is that pretty much every expert agrees that this virus will become endemic. I expect that everyone will get this but the vaccines will protect us from getting severe symptoms. I feel like everyone is really scared of getting this virus even if vaccines protect us from getting severe symptoms. What are we waiting for now? Last year we distanced and wore masks waiting for this vaccine that is suddenly not enough anymore. Now there is nothing else coming. Are we waiting for a third booster? But by the time we get it we'll already need a fourth one. Do we need to do this \"just a bit more\" until we get the fourth one and then the fifth one and so on? Breakthrough cases are happening already. What can we do about that? Get a booster every month? Vaccines are giving us the best chances of only getting mild symptoms but that is still not enough because we might spread this disease and create variants. What is the end goal? I can't see how this will ever end. I feel like everyone forgot how in January we were sure by spring everything will be back to normal. Now we say early 2022. What about early 2022? What will we say then? I think there is no end to this because there will never be a time where covid will go away. This thing infects animals too. How can we ever get rid of it? I felt like we were going in the right direction. We have amazing vaccines that protect us but that is not enough anymore. What is? Please help me understand because I can't see what needs to happen to allow us to go back to normal.",

My whole life before Covid revolved around live music, both playing it and setting up for live events to earn a living. I genuinely don't think it's ever coming back. During May and June I stupidly let myself feel optimism that this would be over soon. I won't make that mistake again. Wasn't it Nietzsche who said that there's no true despair without hope? Whatever. Who fucking cares who said it. I was 28 when this pandemic started and turn 30 in December. That's two years of my life, the last bit of the prime of my youth, stuck inside. I know it's only been a year and a half since it got really bad but let's be honest here, the rest of 2021 is a wash because of Delta, and U.K. scientists just said pretty much definitively that it's only a matter of time before a completely vaccine resistant strain pops up. Looks like it's 2020 forever and ever! Two years of my life, my professional career, my creative outlet, an unfathomable amount of income, my savings, my mental and physical health, are all gone. All I feel anymore is the most extreme degree of anger that a human being is capable of feeling. Every day I read the news and feel like I'm being gaslit. I've given up. I want to believe that it will end, but I just can't. Two months of near normalcy and then it's like it's March 10th, 2020 all over again.",

I do have very bad anxiety, especially around health, so it's possible it's that, but I normally only have palpitations once or twice a year despite my anxiety and despite drinking caffeine every day (I haven't had any caffeine since getting the shot).

But when I look at the covidvaccinated reddit and read about people having long-term horrible effects from the vaccine, or people suddenly dying, it scares me again. I messaged my doctor and she still recommended getting the second shot. I'm just scared because I know the second shot is supposed to be worse. I'm supposed to get it on the 8th and got a text today about scheduling it, and I'm just paranoid and don't know what to do. I feel like I can't really talk to my family about it because they were wildly against me getting it in the first place and keep trying to talk me out of the second one, but I can't afford a bunch of doctor's visits on my own.

With that being said I am of course vaccinated and use this page a lot when i am feeling overwhelmed. There isn't a minute where covid isn't on my mind and it's hellishly overwhelming. My vaccinated family is basically over it and just does whatever and makes me not want to see them. I feel very alone and spend most of my time alone. I feel with cases rising and no chance of them slowing down soon ( in the U.S ) I'm feeling very down and alone. I'm not by any means suicidal but when I say I don't know how much more of this I can take on my psyche I mean it. My health anxiety makes me feel like if I were to get delta even fully vaccinated and young ( 25m with heart arrhythmia and vapes ) that I would succumb to it. I know statically that's not likely but just venting a bit. Any reassurance or kind words at this point would be helpful. I'm really struggling.",

However, recently, I have been seeing more stories of young individuals being hospitalized and wishing they received the vaccine. This is when my mind changed. I don't want to be a news article. I want to be here for my family. I understand many of you out there may be nervous about pursuing the vaccine, but you should know that it will protect you. This is not to say that there is still no risk. I fully intend to continue taking care of myself and making smart choices, however, the lingering doom will no longer be weighing on me.

        "Reddit Post": "On the 9th of July, I was part of a movie workshop. It was a bunch of us film students from my country and few from abroad. The cases in my country were 10 per day (small country with ~1.5 mil people) and those who came abroad had a PCR test. So I was around them outside with no mask. On the 10th I got my first <ORG> shot and on the 11th one of the guys at the workshop was sick. He stayed despite being sick and we were around 23 people, maskless, in a very small theater. I was the only one wearing a mask. On the 12th, guy is even more sick but still breathes and talks around us. Again, everyone but me is maskless. On the 13th he doesn't show up and in the evening we learned that he tested positive for COVID. So you know how this went - NO ONE got infected. No one sitting for 3-4 hours indoors, maskless with him, eating maskless with him, talking next to him, no one in the building got it. 20 people from us were unvaxxed/vaxxed with 1 dose, one was fully vaxxed and two had it. I worked on the movie Festival right after that in the same building and no one anywhere got it. We all got two mandatory tests, both negative for everyone except him. Even the two guys that shared a hotel room with him were negative. And no one even got sick, no one had as little as a headache. I don't understand. I still disinfect groceries. I still wear a mask even outdoors. I lost a dear person to this evil virus. I read people being careful and getting it. And yet 20 people in a room with a symptomatic person resulted in 0 infections. It is driving me crazy. Could it be a false positive from a regular cold? Nothing else makes sense.",

He is coming to stay with my parents, mom is vaccinated/dad is not. I am vaccinated. I worry about going to visit because I know my brother has not been taking any non-mandatory precautions from COVID whatsoever, and thinks that getting vaccinated will \"close his third eye\" (makes me unbelievably sad every time I think about it.). Me and my wife had COVID in February, both cases were pretty bad, but my wife was hospitalized for a day with pneumonia, and has scarring on her lungs now. I don't want to be compulsively worried about it if I'm blowing it out of proportion, but the idea of going and spending time with my family after my brother has been on a plane for a super long time gives me genuine anxiety. I just need some thoughts/perspective, really on the fence about this.",

But, I still get lost in an online spiral of looking at statistics, reading articles, reddit posts, etc. I will find comforting information, but there are always a million more headlines (\"worst is yet to come,\" \"delta will get worse before it gets better\") that make me sick to my stomach. Not to mention, I become unable to be productive in any other area of my life. I am flying soon to see family for the first time since start of the pandemic. I have a cautionary covid test scheduled for before I leave. I just want to be able to look forward to spending time with my family. I'm filled with anxiety and rage and those who will not get vaccinated, as I spent more than a year of my life completely alone to protect myself and others, but someone you cannot even wear a mask to the grocery store? Can anyone relate to this situation? How do you handle the flurry of terrifying headlines while still being well-informed? Should I just stop giving a shit like everyone else my age??",

I lost pretty much my entire mid 20s to this pandemic, and just when things were starting to get better, a new variant had to show up and it got to the point that even us vaccinated people are not 100% safe. During the time that it seemed safe, I planned a surprise dinner for my sisters 23rd birthday, but now Im wondering if I should cancel (cuz the reservations are for indoors, and at this point itll be hard to find anything else). SoI wonder it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are popping) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated? Im young as well (in my mid 20s) and everyone is also around the 23-26 range. All the people I live with are also vaccinated, and same with anyone who would be in our party (tho some of us are still with parents). I do live in an area with high transmission, so l guess Im worried about some random unvaccinated person a couple of tables over coughing and somehow having those droplets reach us.",

We were told 2 weeks, and it turned into months. We were told vaccines would mark the beginning of the end, yet it just seems that the past is repeating itself. I hate it all. This coming fall semester I am taking a full set of classes. I am meant to go on site but looking at how we are reacting to these variants I doubt it will be anywhere close to a normal semester. If we go hybrid or remote, I will not succeed, I have ASD and I suffered and stressed through my classes in the spring semester to get decent grades, and I only had 3 courses. Not to mention the loss of social gatherings would just make me feel isolated and alone once again. As a psych major, I know that these strong reactions come from the trauma experienced going through lockdown the first time. But it feels like a cycle, it feels like nothing is enough. The vaccine wasn't enough, they said it was, but clearly now it isn't. So when and how does this end? I'm losing hope, and like others on this sub I feel that my youth is being taken from me. I feel cheated, and lied to, by my government, and by society as a whole.",

My dad said that they are getting old and won't be alive forever, but what good does saying that do? If they got COVID, they could die.

While this may be true, I still feel like this can just be a scare tactic click-bait scam. Weve known this whole time that vaccines arent some silver bullet. What I want to know is do the vaccines still make the Lambda variant less deadly? There have been breakthrough infections with the Delta variant, but almost no one ends up in the hospital in those breakthrough infections. Am I wrong to think that so long as our vaccines just turn this virus into something more like the common cold or the flu, then thats a win?

My siblings are also around as well as my nephews and nieces. However as I am on the train home I'm starting to deeply regret my decision. Yesterday we had a big argument because I suggested that we should do those quick self tests just to feel a little bit more safe. They are all vaccinated, but me being only 24 did not have the chance to get it yet (this is Portugal by the way, I know in the US for instance I could already get my vaccine). Anyway, they basically disagree said that they are safe now so they would not have any care, and go out and won't get tested. I've tried to reason explaining that I am still unvaccinated amd therefore at higher risk than them, and would be more comfortable of we still were a bit careful. I am not asking them to get tested every day, I plan to test myself very 4 days or so but would be fine if they did it once a week or so (doing what 2 tests in total while I am there). I'm feeling terrified, they say that I am being selfish for trying to impose some rules, but I am just trying to protect myself, I am absolutely terrified of getting Covid, and have been able to resist all this time and want to continue to do so. What do you advise me to do? What can I do to protect myself from my family? I plan to wear my mask in common spaces even though I know it annoys them, and maybe trying to prepare my food separately when they are not around. Being careful to wash my hands a lot and avoiding close contact with them as often as I can. Is there any crucial thing I should do too or am I forgetting something? Please help me, I am freaking out.",

Looking for support or advice So over the past year/2years I've had gnarly allergies and developed chronic nasal congestion, reguring sore/swollen throat, and occasional shortness of breath. Ontop of that I have chronic faituge and since I was a kid Ive had IBS symptoms so occasionally have diarrhea. I feel like every single month I have *some* combination of these symptoms, usually lasting 1-2 weeks per cycle. And am exhausted from all the paranoia around, is it covid?? Do I need to get tested and isolate?? Am I infecting people arlund me?? Do i need to disclose *all* of my symptoms to everyone I meet?? It feels like my body is just falling apart constantly, qnd every time I get tested for covid it comes out negative. (Got tested maybe 7/8 times over the past year. Feels like my body is becoming the Boy Who CrIed Wolf, and then one day if it actuslly is covid, I'm scared Im writing it off as part of the chronic/reccuring ailment. Feels like Im wasting so much time and energy on this when a cycle starts back up. Not sure how to navigate this, and its exhausted being anxious all the time, both being afraid of putting friends at risk, and also not wanting to let me anxiety gdt in the way of social/life activities. I question if I have hypochondria, and at the same time, I do have legitimate symptoms.

The short version is that my partner and I are both fully vaxxed but also both \"high risk\". Before Delta showed up in the US we booked a trip to a Florida beach with our also vaxxed but not high risk friends. At the time I had no concerns about the trip at all. But now I'm looking at the news in Florida and am starting to have concerns about the trip. We'd be going a few weeks after schools opened and it looks like hospitals are already filling. My partner works (fully masked) with the public, so I know we could already catch Delta at any time, but I am worried about catching it a 14 hour drive from home and in a place with very limited medical support. We also have very limited funds and really couldn't afford to extend our stay in the case that we got too sick to make the drive back up. We also really can't afford to have my partner take a week off from work and then take off another 10 days if we ended up exposed. I don't want to disappoint my friends though who already asked weeks ago to promise that we would go on the trip no matter what happened with Delta. I know that isn't a good reason to do something, but I am wondering if I'm being overly cautious and ruining a trip for three people unnecessarily. I know breakthroughs are relatively rare, but I already know half a dozen people at work who had them and their symptoms were way more in line with \"flu\" than \"sniffles\". Again, I know that we still need to live our lives and the vaccines are extremely protective, but since we are high risk, low funds, and would be so far from home, I'm worried about what would happen if we were to get sick down there. Does anyone have any input on if this is relatively safe or a bad idea? The beach itself is more residential and fairly remote from what I can tell. Thank you!",

From Apr 2020 to March 2021 I kept her off the ice, I was worried about covid. She plays ice hockey, and she's not a casual player, pre-covd she was skating 6 out of 7 days a week. And she loved it, would get upset that 1 day we didn't go. She asked everyday when lessons would start again. Is it safe to let her play again this fall/winter? Signs up start in a week! So I need to make my decision and I am having so much anxiety about it. She will be wearing a mask at all times in the rink and I contacted the organization and they said unless the city changes the mandates, there will be no enforcing masks and no extra precautions. The ice rink was built last spring, and I heard it has great ventilation from other coaches, so I think that's a plus. I'm just worried about the other kids not wearing masks after being in school all day (But, our city has a mask mandate for in person schooling, masks must be worn in the building).",

But ever since then, chatter has gradually increased about this, and Jack has doubled down on his claims: [url] <PERSON>' latest show has now put a date on it: August 11. And if you search \"august 11 lockdown\" or \"biden lockdown\" on Twitter, an increasing amount of people are talking about it. Now I know that these are really not credible sources (I mean, <PERSON>? Come on...), but given how the Detla variant is tearin through the country and mask mandates are being brought back, I'm starting to get worried there might be some truth to this. Ever since Jack's first tweet, I've been obsessively searching for any and all signs of whether or not it's truly happening and it's turned me into an anxiety-ridden mess. Even though all evidence and logic point to it not happening (no restrictions beyond masks are being implemented anywhere, <PERSON> outright saying we don't need lockdowns anymore, vaccine rates are increasing, the DOW isn't nosediving like it did in early March 2020, the Rt is starting to decrease in many hard-hit states), the CDC's sudden switch on masks has set a precedent for a sudden switch on lockdowns happening too. What are you guys' thoughts on this? Should I (or rather, we) be worried about this? One of the main reasons I got vaccinated as soon as I could was so that I could return to a normal life. The fear of it potentially being snatched away again is eating me alive on a daily basis.",

Now Ive had ocd before this and ever since this started it got so terrible. Honestly bless my wife for putting up with me. I went the whole 9 yards with the disinfecting and not touching anything and If somebody including me would touch something or mess up the routine of coming home all hell would break loose with me. Part of the reason it got so bad was because we have a son who was 1 at the time and is now 2 1/2 and I dont ever want him to get this virus. So of course if i can do anything to prevent that I will. Fast forward now and i am completely different thankfully. Although I gotta say there are still quite some things that I wish I could let go. One of those is showering. I take a whole hr washing every body part for like 20 seconds multiple times. On top of that I constantly wash my hands repeatedly after touching a dirty part of my body that hasnt been cleaned yet. This also because I go to the gym so I psych myself out. I always end my showers with cleaning the inside of the shower including the handles as a just in case as well. Even when I come home I take my clothes off then proceed to spray alcohol where I took them off. I really wanna stop. I know transmission through touch is very rare but my OCD is getting to me still. Any tips or help?",

Everyone in my household is vaccinated, including myself. The job would be less than 20 hours a week. The employer isn't requiring vaccination for employees, only that non-vaccinated employees wear masks and I'm unsure how well that's enforced. If I do take it, I'll of course wear a mask. I've been unemployed for a long while now but I'm in the incredibly privileged position where I don't need to work to live. But I'd really like to have a job. I'm not doing anything right now (school, job, stay-at-home parent raising kids) and I wish I could contribute to the household. (For the record, absolutely no one living with me holds the fact that I'm unemployed against me and they know I've been trying really hard.) I've been looking for a long time and decided to apply for a part time position a while back so I have something to do as I continue looking for full time work. Cases seem to be rising across the board, new mutations are coming into play, and I suspect things will get worse as schools open up. I really want the job but I'm so conflicted. Is it worth the risk to work with the public when I don't absolutely need to? Or am I being too risk-averse? Currently what I've been doing is job hunting, volunteering remotely, and I'll be tutoring as well (*much* lower pay than the retail position and not as many hours).",

She's a nice lady but she brushes off whatever I say when I try to explain the vaccine to her. I'm not great with words or debating topics either, so whenever I try I feel like I get lost on what I'm trying to say. She's of the mind that the doctors and scientists who are experts on the subject are actually lying, and believes that whatever loon she finds on the internet is a *real* expert just because they say so, and that the government is trying to keep them from telling the truth. She's convinced that everyone who got the shot will end up autistic within a year. (Yet somehow she didn't mind taking me to the vaccination site when I got it?) I'm 24, I've had issues with anxiety and depression since my early teens that have kept me behind where I should be in life, so I'm still completely reliant on my parents. I love my mom, but I'm starting to feel resentment toward her and its scaring me. Honestly, the vaccine thing is just one issue that's part of deeper issues I'm having with her. They're related, But they're not all about covid and the vaccines so I wont bring them up here. It got to the point today that I ended up in tears over the thought of living with her. I feel like her views on vaccines and the other things could make it unsafe for me both physically and emotionally. I could live with my dad, but he's going to be living about an hour away in a smaller town. I wanted to live with my mom because it's still in the city and closer to my friends, who are already an hour away in the other direction. I feel stuck and I'm having trouble seeing things working out. If anyone has any support or advice to offer, I'd appreciate it. I really need it right now,",

It first started because I didnt want to risk passing anything to my higher risk parents, but it also had to do with seeing friends lose family members to the virus. My parents ended up getting it (not surprised, considering they didnt take precautions all that seriously). Thankfully it wasnt serious - pretty bad symptoms, but nothing requiring hospitalization. Everyone has since been vaccinated and now seems to not care as much. Theyre comfortable dining outdoors, seeing friends, and forget to wash their hands for the full 20 seconds after coming home sometimes. Meanwhile, Im not comfortable with any of that, and I still wash my hands religiously, wipe down high touch surfaces, etc. Ive moved out during the pandemic, which has helped me since I honestly do not feel safe at home (COVID-wise). My family sometimes makes me feel bad because if we ever do get together for dinner, we cant eat outdoors because of me. Or Ill ask that they limit seeing others in the week prior to us getting together. Im supposed to be seeing my family for the first time in a few months tomorrow. I again asked them to not see people, which they agreed to. My mom saw a few friends, and my sister attended a wedding. I told my family I will no longer be going to dinner tomorrow. Part of it is COVID - yes, I dont want to go home especially after my sister went to a wedding. But a big part of it is the constant making me feel bad about my boundaries (which Ive clearly communicated) this entire time. Its the constant not respecting my boundaries, and its really frustrating. I guess this is me venting but also wondering if Im being dramatic and I should similarly stop caring so much now that I (and the rest of my family) are fully vaccinated.",

My first dose (March 2021) was not really bad except a sore arm which went away after a day or two. The second dose had a stronger immune response, which is expected. The following day after my second dose, I woke up with a sore arm, very warm and almost fever like feeling (but not actual fever just very warm body temperature), and of course a really bad headache. I was out and unable to do just about anything for a day and fortunately, it was on a weekend (the day after I got my 2nd dose), and after one day, my headache was much more manageable and wasn't as debilitating as the previous day. Personally (speaking for myself and maybe others as well), I would do it all again if it means to put the pandemic in the past and also to get continued immunity against Covid19 as well as the variants. I'll even take the booster shots and go through the suffering if it means that I can live a normal, pre-covid life again. Anyways, I hope this post (along others who gotten their vaccines) will help put some people's fears of the vaccines at ease. I am hoping for the pandemic to end sooner than later.",

So, after I graduated high school, I started planning things to do before I inevitably have to go. Traveling different cities I've never been to, working out to finally gain some muscles, And visiting various countries... That was until the early 2020 hit me. Daegu and every other cities have turned into one of the most dangerous places to go, the gym i was about to go has closed, and international travels have stopped. I was shocked, but I eventually have gotten it over since I could just postpone the enlistment at that time, to make sure that I could do it in 2021. But as the recent worldwide delta variant caused all of the countries that were finally lifting the quarantine - even the ones that have pretty much achieved \"the herd immunity\" vaccination rates to bounce all the way back to mid 2020, I am slowly becoming doubtful if I could ever be able to do as what I planned a couple of years ago. If I delay my enlistment again, my college studying plan will be ruined and will have terrible disadvantages over my friends who already have gone to the Korean army and probably will return earlier than me. And even if I enlist myself and serve in 2022 as I am planning right now, I won't have much time to do all the things I wanted, as I am aiming to become a professor and probably will be busy for most of my life after I return.

Nobody cares to get it. I have patients with no masks most of the time and most arent vaccinated either. It makes me so anxious and I hate it. They literally breathe on top of me.

I understand the need for a vaccine passport (it should just be your vaccine card not something on your phone) to enter a country, but I am starting to feel uneasy with a number of the restrictions at this point and at some point we do have to just live with Covid and not put in restrictions for a region or city for a period of time.

However, I would not pay attention to those who say that in America it will be until 2023. Yes, the Delta variant is an obstacle. But the truth is that there are vaccinations increasing. And next month the childrens vaccine is coming. I still feel that next year in America will be even better than 2021 in that normalcy should be back, especially with more vaccinated. Just because this Delta is bad does not mean the end is no longer in sight. So please, pay no attention to people who are predicting it to be even longer. That will only discourage you.

So essentially, I have a big fear of getting OCD on my hands, clothes and personal items &amp; then ultimately touching my face which would give me coronavirus. So to fix this, I will wash my hands, wash my clothes and sanitize my personal items. This is just a vicious circle that is ruining my life, I've got to stop it. I really am doing it obsessively. Here are some examples: \\- Washing my hands after using the self-service machine in a supermarket \\- Washing my hands after touching a door handle \\- Sanitising my phone after touching a public door handle &amp; then touching my phone \\- Sanitising my bag or other personal items after someone else touching it \\- Sanitising my car after touching various public items (door handles, restaurant tables etc.)&amp; then touching my car How realistic actually is it from getting coronavirus from these things if I didn't wash and sanitize? In short, I was wondering if anybody has any scientific evidence that could help ease my anxiety/OCD and serve as a guideline for me? Thanks in advance.",

For one, the majority of classes at my school are being held full remote in the fall, though this is something Ive known about for months. Today, however, I just found out that my local anime convention, AnimeNYC, will not only be requiring the vaccine for all attendees, but they will also be requiring all attendees to wear a mask. I was already frustrated at de Blasio for trying to segregate NYC with the vaccine, but Ive become even more frustrated now that AnimeNYC has chosen to give in. I myself am already fully-vaxxed, but I think it is insane that they are requiring masks on top of it. If vaccines werent mandatory, I could understand requiring masks, but they are now being required at a vax-only event. I absolutely hate not being able to see faces in public, and Id hate it even more at the event I look forward to the most. Not only that, but other cons are implementing mask policies that dont allow costumes to have masks that cover the acceptable face coverings, making it impossible to cosplay certain characters. I thought for sure that the end of the year would give us total normalcy, but based on my classes being remote for the third semester in a row, and conventions introducing restrictions that change cosplay for the worse, I fear that the Delta variant is going to make the rest of this year a total shit show.",

I know vaccines don't make you 100% immune from the disease, but I thought initial studies had shown that the mRNA vaccines were extremely effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death (I almost want to say that initial studies suggested 100% protection from serious cases, but I could be remembering incorrectly).

I wore a surgical mask, one friend was unmasked in the back seat, and another sat in the front and wore a KN95 (but never took it off). I did unmask to eat but I also put the windows down. We all hung out for probably around 3 hours in my car. My friend who wore the KN95 is very sick, and while we're still waiting on the test he probably has COVID given the severity + the fact he already had a cold this month. He started showing symptoms today (Tuesday) and was otherwise asymptomatic the day we hung out. All three of us are vaccinated and the unmasked friend also previously had COVID half a year or so ago. So far he seems to feel okay. It's only been two/three days since then and I feel fine. What's my exposure risk?",

I dont go out right now. The girl and other anti vax family members will also be at the bridal shower and wedding (that means standing right next to her during the ceremony for over an hour). I might just bail on the Bach party and demand that anyone unvaccinated gets tested before the wedding or any parties. My friend and her family are doing NOTHING to protect the overall group, theyre just like welll the vaccinated people will be fine. I asked my friend about Covid tests for the bachelorette party and she was like sure, she would handle asking people. but never moved on it. Now its a week away and the anti vXer is flying in from out of state. My friend has also said some weird stuff like Covid is culling the herd or something and people need to die for climate change to go away. Honestly I think thats pretty fucked. I just hate how she is handling this. My mom is vaccinated but compromised and heavily involved in the wedding too. I just dont think its worth it. Im so frustrated with this that I might just bail altogether. What are your thoughts?",

But it really sucks to live at a boarding school and have to wear masks pretty much all the time. I am going to a military school and we have extremely strict mask rules. Basically we have to wear a mask all day, anytime we are outside of our rooms. That means in class, outside, training, even just hanging out. We even have to mask up for sports practice and games. It usually comes out to basically wearing a mask from 6:30 in the morning to 10 at night with quick breaks for meals. Marching in 100degree weather while wearing a mask is awful. It pretty much instantly gets stuck to my face with sweat and i have to peel it off. And our faculty and Student Commanders are very strict...they see us talking with lowered masks we get chewed out. Even outside. And in the game room, we can loose privileges if our mask is down too long to take a drink. It's so depressing to just be hanging out, playing games, but fully masked. We can only snack in our rooms or distanced in the mess hall (even there we have to mask up as soon as we finish). And we have extremely strict dining rules...while eating, we can only talk when we are finished and have masked up again. idk I know it's important, and I know they take it seriously, but it such a bummer.",

I am now fully vaccinated with Biontech (I got my second shot on 24.07) and I want to hang out with friends again. My BF's cousin invited me to drink at his house. In total there would be four people (me, my bf, his cousin and his girlfriend). Everyone is fully vaccinated. Up until now, I have only stood in front of people with my FFP2 mask. I try to be less worried but I don't really have the guts to take it off unless I'm outside and no one's in sight.. I've met my BF a couple of times outside after I got my second shot but we both kept our masks on at all times. So, I really want to ask if it is safe to see people without masks when everyone is fully vaccinated. I am 23F and I have asthma and rheumatoid Arthritis. The one person who worries me in my family is my mom. She has diabetes, hypertension, hashimoto's, liver disease etc. She is in her early 50s. She is fully vaccinated with <ORG>. (Everyone else is my family is vaccinated too btw) I live with her, so if I do catch COVID despite being vaccinated, I am afraid I would pass it onto her. Alternatively, I also thought about isolating myself for some time after my hangout. I would be fine wearing a mask around my family for 1-2 weeks. I get tested regularly anyways (once a week) so there's that, too. Sorry if this seems paranoid, I just wanna be on the safe side. But I also get so depressed not having seen anyone for so long.",

It wasn't bad, we just had a couple things that smelled awful, now about 6 months later, I'd say the parosmia is about 90% better for both of us. I feel great physically. I'm taking better care of my body, and I lost almost 20 pounds so far. But I keep reading these damn studies. I keep thinking I must have some kind of brain damage. I've convinced myself that my parosmia is a sign of brain damage, based off the following studies: [url] [url] I feel good, probably the best I have in a while, but mentally I can't stop thinking there must be something wrong with me. Am I being crazy? Are my fears legitimate? I keep hearing all of this \"we don't know\" and \"there could be permanent effects\". And it's driving my anxiety completely wild. I feel so scared and depressed.",

Im in a very blue area and masks have come back in a nearby town and the university I attend is requiring both masks and vaccines this fall, due to Delta. I feel like its only a matter of time until mask mandates are in my town again for everything and its really making me spiral. I got the vaccine and had no problem with it, but it feels like it doesnt even matter at this point. If an entire campus that is vaccinated, surrounded by a community with high vaccinations, isnt safe then what would ever be safe?! Im deeply worried that masks are just a permanent part of life now in public, at least in my area. Ive voiced my concerns with some people and I just get shot down with its just a piece of cloth, its no big deal, itll just be temporary, etc. Maybe Im crazy but masks are worst part of the pandemic for me. I wore them where required this whole time, but wearing them and even seeing them really negatively effects my mental health. I feel like Im trapped in a dystopian movie and cant escape. A constant reminder to be afraid, that this isnt safe. I just hate how these concerns are always just swept aside as being whining or whatever. I just dont see how masks wont become permanent given the current logic of the mandates (vaccinated people can still spread). Can someone just give me some copium that these mandates will be over quickly? Like if the Delta wave ends, can I take the mask off? As crazy as it sounds, the new mask mandates are scarier to me than the Delta wave itself, but I feel like Im the only one who is upset about it.",

I work remotely, and rarely go outside of my house besides the occasional grocery store trip or restaurant pick-up window. I've been on the fence about getting the vaccine, purely because I have massive health anxiety and I've been told a while back that there's a risk I have a heart issue (left-ventricular hypertrophy) as well as PVCs. I don't have any symptoms other than the occasional skipped heart beat, but reading through some of the cardiac side effects people have experienced and seeing stories of myocarditis/pericarditis has really made my anxious. However, I'm also terrified of catching COVID and dealing with potential side effects or long-term effects from that as well. My state and city are a current Delta hot-spot and I don't see it getting much better in the near future. Unfortunately, I moved earlier this year and finding a primary care doctor has been a nightmare. The fastest I can see one is the end of this month, but I don't know if I should wait that long. I feel this immense guilt on me every day that I didn't get vaccinated sooner, or try and see a doctor sooner, and I just would love any and all advice you all might have for me. Thanks!",

I have read myriads of people's comments saying how they got it back in a matter of days or weeks max a few months. I got covid back in october 2020. I got a fever that lasted a day but in a matter of 1 to 2 days my taste and smell completely vanished and they havent come back yet. My smell does work but not as it should. Most of the time food has a bland burned-ish type of smell. As for taste, it isnt there at all. I can tell the difference between salty and sweet food. I can also tell some food have a different pattern than others. For example beans have a very strong and \"yummy\" texture. But I cant taste them at all. I never lost my appetite though. I still eat like I normally would. The feeling that my favorite foods leave in my mouth I think is what make them still enjoyable. And also I have always been a \"eat to live\" and not \"live to eat\" type of person so that also helped.",

Im 21 and have already had COVID a few months ago. My whole family are vaccinated but I just really really am wary about it. Im not a conspiracy nut, Im a left wing socialist student who is usually on the \"left\" for many many issues. The two things about this vaccine that gets me is that there have been no long term trials and the censorship coming from the pharmaceuticals . Firstly, my anxiety about the long term trials comes from all the previous drugs that failed on mass as a result of improper testing (thalidomide for example). Secondly, I *really* dont like that the pharmaceutical companies that made the vaccines included no liability clauses in their contracts w/ the gov, and they have made BILLIONS- why would they want to admit the vaccine didnt work even if we saw hundreds of adverse reactions? I feel like there is no transparency and I just dont trust them to let us know if it does go wrong. Ive always been wary of big business and this is the first thing I thought when the vaccine was created last year and I just havent been able to think differently on this issue Thats literally all I think. I agree that we should all be vaccinated. I want to be vaccinated but these two doubts are stopping me. Have any of you overcome your fears? Does anyone have any info that will me less anxious? Ive tried to talk to my friends about it and they dismiss my concerns but I feel like Im not being difficult with my views here and are genuine, common sense concerns? Thank you for reading and giving your responses :)",

I'd worked from home since long before the world went remote and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 year old since her birth. We're very much homebodies, so the lockdowns and such weren't a huge departure from the life we'd been leading prior. That's all changed with the school year quickly approaching. We'd initially planned on sending our daughter to Pre-K last year but opted not to because of our concerns about the virus. With an October birthday she's going to be one of the older kids in class this year and she is severely overdue for the type of social interaction that school provides. Anyway, sending unvaccinated kids back to school with the more transmissible Delta Variant being prevalent seems like a recipe for disaster to me. However, I don't think my kid can afford to be isolated another year. We're in a city where Pre-K is provided through the public school system on a first come first serve basis, so, pulling her and reenrolling her later in the semester once vaccinations are available for children under 12 isn't an option. On the plus side, masks are required but its a full-day class, so the kids have to remove those for breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm just at a loss for what to do and it disgusts me that we're still in this situation. At this point, my daughter would be absolutely heartbroken if we pulled her out of school but I'd much rather her heartbroken than suffer any longterm effects (or severe effects) of COVID. I'm sure there are plenty of parents out here dealing with the same and I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

I am very pro-vaccine in every sense, but I think the misinformation being spread, and the side effects being put on blast from the Covid-19 vaccine are scaring me a bit. I've always had pretty substantial health anxiety; I actually had a bit of a breakdown in March of 2020 (quit my job and everything). I live in a very rural, Republican area, and everyone around me is constantly bashing the vaccine and spreading HUGE amounts of scary and sometimes false information. I have not been vaccinated for Covid-19, but I'm very much on the fence. I'd say a solid 60% want to get the vax and 40% of me is terrified of it. On one hand, I'm scared to get vaccinated, but on the other, I'm absolutely petrified of getting Covid. I'm so scared of the rare but possible side effects of the vaccine, but of course, I'm more scared of the long-term side effects of actually contracting Covid-19. I've heard all sorts of side effects from the vaccine, like myocarditis and pericarditis, blood clots, heavier menstruation, and it all just really scares me. I think what I'm searching for in particular are words of wisdom from all walks of life. Whether you got vaccinated right away with no second thought, whether you were on the fence like me, or even if you were 100% against it and got it anyway. I'd also love to hear your side effects from the vaccine, and how you're feeling now. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and offers any positivity whatsoever. Thanks, you guys.",

A recent study out of the University of Maryland presents the first evidence that full vaccination against COVID-19 actually SUPPRESSES emergent mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants therefore successfully debunking the myth that vaccines promote mutations. &gt; &gt;COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2 and full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant mutation frequency. Researchers here showed that countries with higher vaccination rates generated FEWER mutations, suggesting less of a chance for the virus to gain virulent mutations in high vaccinated countries. Researchers found vaccination coverage rate was inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 16 countries of 20 countries studied and discovered Delta variants evolved differently under the positive selection pressure in the United Kingdom and India.

Something feels off, as my state should be in a good situation, but we're still seeing rising case numbers. I simply don't understand it, and as someone who suffers from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Depression, and ADHD, I am so shocked that progress is reversed in this state. I've been having panic attacks, tremors, and headaches, because I'm worried that all my plans for the remainder of the year (movies, my first rave in Berkeley on 9/18, etc.) could be shot down. I feel like it will be fine with high vaccination rates, but look at Hawaii. They're having more restrictions and they have vaccinated 85% of their adult population It can be easy to blame the unvaccinated, but unless they're immunocompromised or under 12, I'm sorry, I don't care about them. Fuck em. \"Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\". Just require vaccines for non essential places (bars, movies, clubs, restaurants, gyms). I hate masks, but it's not the end of the world (I live in LA, so they're required). Are my fears/stresses justified? Or Do you think It'll be fine, and I should just try to think about the present? Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry if I sound so paranoid. Uncertainty is my biggest fear, and it's been eating my alive for about a month now.",

You can imagine how much I miss them I started hearing news of some cons reopening with varying restrictions, (though I wish those restrictions were tighter) and had hope of a 2022 con season. In fact, my favorite con announced they're returning in January and I'm hoping to go. However, a con called megaplex just took place, and immediately after accounts of catching covid started pouring in, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated (because of delta). Conventions are infamous for spreading illness even before covid, so there's a real scare here. Now I'm seeing takes that absolutely zero conventions should take place in any capacity, and more specifically that it's better for them to go under than to think about reopening. As if it's easy for an organization low on money to just run a convention again. And it depresses the hell out of me. having a mask rule + proof of vaccination + limited capacity really shouldn't be hard...but the worst part is I know that at this point that might not even be enough. If with those two things, we STILL can't hold them at all, when the hell are we ever getting out of this? I'm so tired, I just wanted this little glimmer of something to look forward to, and now it's fading away more Its just super spreader event after super spreader event as things try to come back it feels like.

It huts even more because I feel like I've been vaxxed, I've done my part, why should I and others who did the right thing be punished with more lockdowns or social shaming that we should isolate?

Knowing how lockdown happy and reactionary Canadian governments can be in terrified for the fall being just like fall 2020. I cannot waste another year of life again. My fear is that the unvaccinated will drive a huge surge and the province will go full lockdown mode as a reactionary measure. If we have to lockdown again with so many people vaccinated then Ill have lost all hope for life and be completely defeated. If the vaccines cant stop this, then Ill have tapped out. I dont know how to stop my spiral thinking. Ive tried to avoid all news and case counts but its inescapable. Lockdowns again would mean losing my side projects in events and pretty much leave me defeated.",

So, how do I know what's safe? How do I know what buildings I enter have good ventilation? Are there any resources to help figure these things out? All I've seen are a limited list of \"here's some safe and non safe activities\", but the list has only a small amount of activities that I would probably have never done anyway, and don't compare to things I usually do, so I can't even adjust the situation and use them as a rule of thumb.",

They are requiring a rapid test negative within 72 hours for all attendees, but I'm not sure if they're requiring vaccination. Masks are required, but because I'm in the coffee industry people will be demoing products and there will be tastings, especially in the workshops I'm teaching. Plus I'll have to take at least two legs of a flight to get there, so crowded airports are a risk, and this is an event that usually has an international audience, so there's the potential to introduce new variants. If people are getting rapid tests before they fly, what about if they pick something up during travel and spread it at the event? &amp;#x200B; I'm vaccinated, but I'm still really scared of catching COVID because I'm a sensory/flavor scientist and losing my sense of taste or smell could kill my career and make my PhD practically worthless for anything I'm interested in doing, and there haven't been enough break-through cases yet to know if permanent loss is a risk with mild vaccinated cases like it was for mild unvaccinated cases. &amp;#x200B; But I'm also on the job market, my current contract ends in January so this was going to be the perfect networking event for me. Furthermore, the organization running the expo funds my lab's research, so backing out is not an option unless they cancel the conference entirely - it would hurt both my own career and the relationship my lab has with the organization. &amp;#x200B; I'm so frustrated by this Delta variant uncertainty. I don't know how much my worry is justified. An acquaintance of mine just hosted a party, all vaccinated, and a few days later 1/3 of the attendees tested positive. But maybe I'm overreacting and it's totally fine. I just don't know what's safe anymore.",

Now that things like conventions and IRL meetups are slowly happening again I felt like I \"forgot\" how to socialize with people, being as quiet and antisocial as I've been since probably my whole life. I was diagnosed with ASD when I was really young so I've never been the best at socializing, but this has become an all-time low. My anxiety and depression has come into full swing.

About 20% of the lungs were infected (as per the CT scan at that time) and she recovered at home. The only ongoing problem was a bit of weakness, change in mental outlook and cough. ================================== Now in June 5 an X-Ray was done and the report said: Findings: * Scattered opacities are noted in the both lower zones. * Calcified shadow is seen in the right para tracheal region Impression: Suggestive of pulmonary inflammatory change. ==================================== We went to the Pulmonologist and he said its to be expected from COVID and its nothing serious. My question is: * Can this be a sign of pulmonary fibrosis or something similar like interstitial lung disease? * What are these opacities anyway? * Is this a sign of any permanent damage? Note: My mother had tuberculosis 35 years ago, so the calcified shadow could be due to that or something else as well. This is what the Pulmonologist said. Another important thing to note that in Bangladesh doctors don't tell you the truth. If you have a serious condition they are likely to downplay it and say \"oh its nothing\", so as not to stress the patient or their families. This is the culture. So this is why I am asking here.",

I am not in the US, I am in Southeast Asia where things are really bad here, vaccination rates are low, and most restrictions have not been lifted.

I just hope that people can be more conscious of the fact that there exists a whole world outside of America, and everyone's experiences with COVID is different. Maybe don't jump to conclusions that everyone on reddit is from a developed, Western nation with sufficient resources to deal with this virus? Remember that the WHO said this pandemic will not be over until it's over for the whole world. Even if things seem to be looking up in your country, if the virus is still spreading in other countries, it is just a matter of time before it circles back to the US again (just like Delta).",

Last weekend I hung out with a group of friends at a bar (this bar required proof of vaccine for entry) and my group of 6 were all in close proximity, indoors and sharing food. My friend (fully vaxxed) tested positive for covid a few days later after experiencing very mild symptoms so the rest of us went to get tested as well. We all tested negative with no symptoms! I honestly felt such a relief after this. Not just because I tested negative, but it just truly affirmed for me how well they work. Delta is scary, but had we all not been vaccinated this would have likely been so much worse. We live in a state where Covid hasnt been too bad, and honestly we had relaxed quite a bit, but this definitely was a bit of a reality check but also a major sense of relief at the same time. Get those shots, if you havent yet. Seriously.",

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I genuinely don't know the answer to this. I'm looking for some advice. As the title says, I'm 23 and do not really have any health issues. I ask this question humbly and am at this point looking for some reassurance that I am doing the right thing by agreeing to take the vaccine. I'm scheduled to take it in a few days, I don't know which one I'll be taking (here in my country for some reason they did not let me know which one I'll be given). I don't know what difference it makes which one I'll be taking. I have distanced myself from all the news and am not well informed at all about all the different types of vaccines. It's not a smart thing to do on my part but I've had a tough year and it was the last thing on my mind. I've heard some people say that at my age it's not worth it to take the vaccine because the benefits of not catching a virus that would likely not do much harm to me to begin with is overshadowed by any potential side effects that the vaccine could cause. Is this true? Am I just overthinking this? Could there be any long term side effects from any of these vaccines, or will it really most likely not impact my life in any way other than just maybe getting sick for a couple of days after taking the vaccine (which has happened to some people I know)? TL;DR: All I want to know is, am I doing the right thing by getting vaccinated at my age? Thank you in advance.",

I feel like Ive been mostly very lucky with how my family takes Covid seriously, but Im just at my emotional wits end trying to explain something that seems like it should be obvious. Theyre interpreting the numbers in a way that tries to make an incorrect point about how vaccines dont change your chance of surviving Covid once youve been admitted to the hospital. I feel like Im on crazy pills and dont know how to explain it to them in a way that doesnt make me want to pull my hair out. Theyre looking at the rates of hospitalization and deaths in each state, per 100,000, for fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. Theyre looking at data reported by the NYTimes which was updated 3 days ago. So for example, California, where we live, has reported 647 hospitalizations and 58 deaths for unvaccinated people, and 9 hospitalizations and 1 death for vaccinated people. Now, theyre calculating that 58/647= .089, and 1/9= .11, so you have a higher chance of dying in the hospital from Covid if youre vaccinated (instead of realizing that this data really means you are 58X more likely to die of Covid if youre unvaccinated in CA). Basically theyre saying the vaccine doesnt work to help people who are already hospitalized because you have a higher rate of dying in the hospital if youre vaccinated. This data may be *technically* correct, but its missing the context of the fact that the vaccine keeps people out of the hospital in the first place so one person out of nine dying skews the number outrageously. So what do you guys think, how do I explain to them that this interpretation of data is erroneous??",

I'm hopeful that by the end of the Delta wave in the U.S., enough people will have been inoculated one way or another to prevent another widespread surge. My only concern is the potential emergence of a more vaccine-resistant variant, but I doubt there will be one that completely bypasses the vaccines, due to how the vaccines are formulated. But even so, a vaccine-resistant variant would not be completely foreign to our immune systems like the original strain, so we'd never be put back to square one, right?

I don't necessarily watch the news, I don't like watching news, but every time I've heard bad news about Covid19 and becoming a pandemic, I started lose hope and my mental health got really bad. And I blame the news for that. News always fear monger and that makes people go crazy, sad, scared, and confused. Why, when I was working as a courtesy clerk at Vons, people argue for masks. There was theses two men arguing each other. One is wearing a mask and the other guy is not wearing a mask. The guy not wearing a mask says he believe in science and the other guy wearing mask tells him that he is a selfish a-hole. And the news always makes false information about the vaccines and it's no wonder nobody wants to or too scared to get vaccinated. I was nervous to get vaccinated, but I got vaccinated and it wasn't so bad. Why can't the news be hopeful, for once. Something must be done with the news to end this fear monger if we want to end this pandemic. Sure, the virus will sadly last forever, but they can't let this pandemic last forever. Stupid news!",

Countrywise, 75% of all adults have received at least one dose and this number is still growing, as the rollout is now focused on young adults (18-25) who werent eligible to get their jab before. While this might seem a vaccine success story, it did not come without its hurdles. Vaccine rollout has been dramatic, to say the least. Bolsonaro is an anti-vaccine apologist and has sabotaged vaccine purchases since they first came. Being the 2nd worst affected country in the world, with over 500k dead, didnt change his heart. In stark contrast to other national leaders on the world, he did not get his jab and does not plan to do so. Skepticism and politicization of vaccines soon struck. We are screwed, I thought. Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US. Young people werent likely to get their jab this year. But somehow, it happened. Despite being disdained by the federal government, vaccines were soon became a representation of hope, soon became something the people needed to fight for if we were to have any chance against this disease. Little by little, Brazilian social media feeds were flooded with pics and videos of people being vaccinated. They put on their best clothes, posting their photos with inspiring takes on the importance of vaccines on Instagram. There is even a joke running here this vaccine only works if you post about it on social media This kind of good and organic peer pressure paid off - upon seeing their friends and relatives getting their jab, most Bolsonaro supporters reluctantly jumped in line to get their jab, even those people would avoid being excluded by their families. Against all odds, we are making it. We dont have many fully vaccinated people yet (just 30% of adult population). Peer pressure and social media work wonders. Close people getting their shot and sharing their experiences work better than some celebrity endorsements and free ice cream.",

Had it for about a couple of weeks now. I went to the doctor and he suggested I get a covid test. Have one scheduled for tomorrow morning. I have to admit, quite nervous about it. Not only the result, but the test itself. My housemate spent Saturday at the ER for an unrelated issue and they gave her a covid test and hers was negative. She also told me that it hurt really bad and that she had tears in her eyes from it. She's really the only one I've seen or been close to though for more than 5 seconds. So I'm not sure if I do have it where I could have got it from. If it's not COVID, not sure what it is. Maybe just a bad sinus infection. My taste has been a little screwed up. Both me and my housemate have been vaccinated as well. So I hope if I do have it, that I don't get any sicker than this. At least it seems to have left my lungs alright so far.",

I am so afraid. I have been having constant nausea and stomach pain for the past month, and I tried to just ignore it but this morning it was excruciating. I folded and went to the ER (even the thought of it was terrifying to me, but the pain was so bad). I was there for about 2 hours, had blood work and a CT done, nothing serious found, was prescribed some medication and my stomach ailment should be better soon thats good, right? Yeah. My anxiety about that has evaporated, but now Im hyper focused on the possibility that I was exposed to COVID while I was there. Delta is going crazy, and they treat plenty of COVID patients at that hospital just thinking of how many covid positive individuals shared a chair with me in the waiting room or my recliner in the hospital room makes me shudder. Im utterly terrified. I came into close-ish contact with nine hospital employees in that two hours. No interaction lasted more than 15 minutes, most being shorter. Everyone was masked. Ive tried to search for others posts worried about a similar issue, but I havent really found much Im just so scared, guys. It hasnt even been eight hours since I left the hospital and Im already a nervous wreck. How will I possibly survive the next two weeks worrying :( I know I sound silly. Im sorry",

My boss, the only doctor in the private healthcare office I work for (all vaccinated, as far as I am aware), tested positive yesterday after feeling ill on Thursday. I was in the office around him often for 8 hours on Wednesday and for two hours on Thursday before he went home, wearing masks the whole time. In addition, the other person working in the office on Wednesday is now feeling ill and is getting tested as well. I am having no symptoms and tested negative using a rapid result test on Sunday, but I know those can throw false negatives, so I got a PCR test today along with my roommates who I could've potentially exposed and am now waiting on the results from that. My boss says if I test negative I should be able to go in from Thursday on (even though the practice will be mostly non-functioning given he's obviously not going in for at least a week), but I don't trust his advice given he's been attending weddings and conferences this summer. Even if I do test negative, because I work in a healthcare setting (non-emergency, I don't want to give the exact profession but in a similar vein to a physical therapist's office) I feel I should quarantine for the full ten asymptomatic days to be certain I'm not going to experience delayed infection, and because I live with immunocompromised and at-risk individuals. Is this an unreasonable ask? He's making me feel unreasonable for being wary at the thought of going in before I've quarantined the full amount; we only have a handful of front desk staff and if even one of us gets sick the others have to pick up the slack. On a more personal note, is there any way y'all have found to deal with the intense guilt of potentially exposing people to Covid? I've been doing everything I can since March 2020 to avoid this exact scenario and it feels so endlessly frustrating that simply working to try to survive has landed me in this mess.",

We can take the VA data to reflect the effectiveness of the vaccine over all. * less than 2% of covid cases in VA are related to fully vaccinated individuals * out of all fully vaccinated individuals in VA, less than 1% have developed covid (and less than 0.01% were hospitalized due to covid) * graphs at the bottom of the dashboard really highlight the differences between the fully vaccinated population and everyone else Note: Some can't get vaccinated even if they want to (due to medical reasons, etc.) so it's important not to lump together everyone who hasn't gotten vaxxed.

Well, I just returned to my home state from my internship, and someone I know who was vaccinated and masked was just hospitalized for a week due to the Delta variant (she fortunately returned home yesterday, but I was really worried), and one of the people I wanted to see more than anyone has now had to cancel us getting to see each other indefinitely due to the same variant (we had finally started to make plans to see each other this week after having not seen each other for over 1.5 years before it was really known how bad the Delta variant would be). Im so over having any amount of hope anymore, since I know Ill just get my hopes up, and Im not even looking forward to going back to college this weekend since I feel like things will just be bad again with this variant for who knows how long (even as someone who is young, doesnt have pre-existing conditions, and is fully vaccinated).",

Also, do we know if the 8 months starts at the date of your first vaccine (if you got the double dose MRNA vax) or is 8 months from when you are fully vaccinated (so 14th day after your second shot)? Also also, what about healthy people who had a breakthrough infection this summer? Why the hell would they be recommended to get a booster? I feel like a lot of people on the internet or politically left leaning family members would think Im anti vax for taking this stance. No. I think vaccines save lives.

These are only my feelings at the moment, but I feel like getting them out and having feedback from others would help my COVID recovery, at least mentally. Here it goes. I tested positive for COVID after pretty much my whole family got it. While I only tested positive in the last 16 hours, I have felt off since 8/12. Here is where I'll let you in on my dilemma, and I do not expect pretty much any of you to agree with me. There is a girl that I work with that I think is insanely pretty and cool. I have been gradually getting closer to her over the last few months and I feel like we're really starting to become friends. The problem is, her last day of work is on 8/20 before she goes back to school, and I would really like to stay in contact with her while she is at school. I was planning on asking for her snapchat on 8/20 which is the next and last time I will see her for some time. My COVID diagnosis threw me for a loop I did not expect and if I follow all guidelines I will not be able to see her by the time she leaves for school. This has led to me planning to hide my diagnosis in order to see her and talk to her before she goes away until December. Obviously this puts her and my other coworkers at risk of catching the virus, but I feel like I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't make an effort to talk to her. I know this is immature, and I know that this has an answer that is very obvious to most. I only ask for respectful feedback. Honestly, I'm not sure that I didn't write this up to sort of get my thoughts out in the open, but I really like this girl and want to pursue a relationship with her. Even if not a romantic relationship, I just think she is super cool. Thanks for reading and TIA to anyone with any feedback.",

I honestly don't know what I was thinking-- about an hour and a half in, the space got even more crowded and I finally got uncomfortable enough that I decided to leave. I'm ashamed and embarrassed and at a loss with myself. I promise I'm not looking for reassurance here; I know that I made an awful decision, and I want to handle it now as responsibly as possible to avoid infecting anyone in my community. I'm fortunate to be a grad student at a university where we have access to incredibly accurate rapid testing (results in 6-24 hours, generally), and I've decided to self-isolate until I get a negative test result. I canceled several in-person meetings this week, the most important of which being with my thesis advisor who has a 10 year old son. I told him what happened and that I thought we should postpone, and he suggested we met Friday morning, of course pending a negative test result. The new CDC guidelines say that you should get tested 3-5 days after exposure, so my question is, if I test Thursday morning (roughly 4 and 1/2 days after potential exposure) is that long enough to really trust a negative result, or should I wait, push back with my professor, and self-isolate for longer? Could I trust a Friday morning test? Saturday morning? Any advice would be deeply appreciated-- I really appreciate this community and this space.",

What the fuck??? I dedicate a whole fucking year of my time not getting this, getting the vaccine to try and get back to normal, got a ton of shit for it, and now we cant???? I cant just go back to campus like normal for once??? Still gotta wear a mask, now??? Regardless of vaccination status??? Whats going on? I thought this fucking vaccine will protect me. Now it cant, apparently? Why did I even bother? Why did I even bother ? Just let the fucking anti-backers get it and die. They dont care, and I dont care about them anymore. Im done playing super man. Why cant I just have my freedoms again??? Whats wrong with this world? Youre telling me this stupid variant is actually serious, now??? Why are they doing this now? Why cant they go back to normal???? Since when in history has a vaccine not worked to the point where its now overpowering us again (clearly)?",

I have sometimes have ups and downs depression thinking it will never end. But, I've got to visit my psychiatrist yesterday about my depression because of the pandemic. He told me not to lose hope. The pandemic will likely end eventually, even when the virus becomes an endemic. So I'm trying not to lose hope, and I've been keep hearing that the vaccination rates are going up and rumor has it that the Delta Variant will be the last wave. I'm so glad I've got to talk to my psychiatrist about my depression problem and I feel better. We may not know when will this pandemic ends right now, but maybe if the FDA approves more vaccines for kids under 12 this month or the next, then maybe we'll get back to normalcy either later this year or early next year.

In my country of residence, vaccination was very slow, but in my other country of citizenship, vaccines were widely available. I received my first vaccine dose in the country of residence, but the second dose was not to be available for another 3 months. During this period, a close family member in my other country of citizenship became very ill, and I needed to get there immediately. Additionally, in order to be able to see her, because of strict rules, I needed to be fully vaccinated. And so, I took my second vaccine there, and the physician accepted the proof of my first vaccine from my residence country. It was the best decision, because I was able to spend an entire month with my family member, and left feeling at least somewhat less heavy-hearted. The problems is that my residence country will *not* accept my vaccination record from the other country, and so I am officially \"not fully vaccinated.\" What this means is that I cannot be granted the current \"Vaccination Passport\" available to all residents, which allows those fully vaccinated to travel to all other EU countries without quarantine, testing, or other problems. Without this, traveling - which I need to do for my work - will become extremely difficult, often impossible. So I'm thinking of just going to get my \"second\" vaccine here in my country of residence, which is now available, and then the authorities will issue the passport so that I can get on with my life as much as possible. I have read quite a few things from what appear to be reasonable sources online, and it seems that getting a third vaccine within a period of three months wouldn't be harmful - but I obviously want to be very, very careful. Anyone have any solid information/advice one way or the other? Thanks in advance.",

My husband is vaccinated with <ORG> and the coworker who tested positive had the J&amp;J vaccine. Im quite nervous about this because I have some medical things going on right now, and although I am also vaccinated (<ORG>), I still worry my husband will bring it home and I will catch it. I was also planning on visiting some family this coming week, but I dont feel I should do this now in good conscience (my niece and nephew are too young to be vaccinated). Some background, he did not sit near the positive coworker (he said they were around 10 feet away from one another), but nobody was wearing a mask at the meeting because everyone in the meeting was vaccinated. The meeting was only about 20 minutes long. I do not know if any windows were open and/or how big or small the room was. The safety department chair said my husband doesnt need to quarantine because hes vaccinated, but I know weve been seeing a lot more breakthrough cases. Should I isolate from my husband, or is the risk in this situation fairly low? Should I officially cancel the trip to see my family? Side note, everyone in my family is also vaccinated with either moderna or <ORG> except for my niece and nephew, who are again too young to be vaccinated. Id be worried about giving it to them though. Help!",

I haven't seen them since early Saturday and he didn't have any symptoms at all until around Monday night. I have chronic post nasal drip and am always coughing so there is nothing out if the ordinary there.. I have been non-stop checking my temperature for the past 4 hours now. Forehead readings are telling me 98-98.4 and my two oral thermometers are reading between 98.7-99.6 (late afternoon/early evening hours, in a pretty hot bedroom). I had a rapid test done and it came back negative and I am vaccinated anyway. Does anyone know if either these temperatures should be concerning or just ways to help calm down? I've been extremely high strung since 2:30 today, I can't stop thinking about it and I can't focus on anything.",

When I first gradutated highschool they elected a conservative government that absolutely hated people on welfare. Every attempt to get ahead in life has been met by systemic issues that seem impossible to overcome. All this time older people and government constantly gaslight my generation. I have been told all my life how spoiled and privileged I supposedly am when I grew up poor with 2 drug addict parents. Right now I am unemployed, I was formerlly a carer and now the government is refusing to pay me anything for a stupid reason. i have to contact a social worker to beg for pittance. I feel no loyalty to a country and society that has made it clear it hates me. What does this have to do with covid you may wonder? Well here young people can't even get a single vaccine. I can't even get AZ in my area, some can. But basically if you are under 30 there are no vaccines available still. They doubled the cost of university courses during this pandemic, when the uni experience is no longer even half as good as it was. I have no motivation to study in that environment and them doubling the cost has pretty much made me think no way. my age group has the lowest employment rate yet we are the most inelligible for government support in this time. I am sick of trying when everything is made harder, and then my problems are minimized because I am young. I feel like my youth was destroyed by this toxic society, i never got to live the life I wanted, and now covid has trapped me even further in this miserable cycle. I really can't believe that I am nearly 30, basically begging for entry level work or welfare and can't get fucking either. I don't know what I will do in a few months time.",

He and my mom have done their best to stay home, mask up, and now he's being asked to sit all day inside and I'm worried this will put him at risk. They're also vaccinated. Delta hasn't made an impact yet in his area but a lot of the people there don't take it seriously. I'm in Oregon where Delta is now impacting hospitals quite seriously. My dad is a good dude who probably thinks he's doing his duty to serve, but I think right now is absolutely the time for someone else to step in and tell him no. In addition, we lost my 43-year-old brother a year ago unexpectedly and my dad is still reeling from it. He also was picked for a murder trial and I don't think he is prepared to listen or see graphic things about someone dying. I'm wondering if I should call or try to contact someone there about my concerns? I don't think these small towns are taking it so seriously and I don't want to lose my dad.",

I was discussing booster shots with a loved one today, when she expressed regret for having received the vaccination. I had an astonished reaction to hearing this. Her regret was around committing to something where we dont understand the long term effects, the fact that they have only emergency approval; mainly afraid of the unknown around the vaccination she received. I think Im simply fatigued by all the things surrounding this pandemic. The wide and strong spectrum of opinions, the misinformation, the lack of good information Im finding it more difficult to keep open-minded and respectful of peoples wide range of opinions on all things pandemic.

Even talking to my wife and daughter, my wife just doesn't want to talk about it because she feels like there's nothing we can do, and my daughter breaks down into years any time we mention the possibility of having her skip the trip (it's a class bonding thing because everyone in her grade is new to the class this year). I don't know if I'm even looking for advice, I just want to know I'm not the only one dealing with this, because where I live it feels like I am.",

They're both old and my dad has health conditions. Me and my siblings have all gotten it and pretty much all of our extended family has gotten it with minimal/no side effects. I've been trying to be understanding and non-pushy about it (they've been fighting with other family members about it and I know how it's making them dig their heels in) but it's getting annoying listening to them complain about stuff they can't go to or people who won't see them and how stupid everyone is when the solution is right there. Also my mom, even though she's been good about the masks, I got in a fight with her recently for going into a (thankfully empty) store maskless and nearly had to drag her out of another store the other day because she took it off for a while (thankfully without others around). I'm worried this is the beginning of a downward spiral that's going to end with her and my dad on ventilators. I brought this up to her today and she just handwaved it. Any advice?",

As grim as that sounds that a 5th wave could be coming, the good news is that I can promise it will end in mid 2022. The WHO set that goal. Vaccines are being more rolled out not just in the USA. <PERSON> is putting vaccine mandates wherever he can. Covid will eventually run out of people to infect on top of the vaccines. No plague has ever lasted forever. The most important thing that we smart vaccinated folks can do is continue to be optimistic and take solace in both history and the predictions of the WHO. We will be ok, this will end, and life will return. Things may be different in the end but there is an end and life will come back. Stay positive, stay optimistic, and stay safe.",

Im being pelted with this information all the time, and its hard to turn it off when it comes from family members you love and trust. On the other hand: I caught COVID in November and am still sorta messed up. Smell and taste arent the same, chronic insomnia and brain fog I dont wish this on anyone, and I consider myself lucky for having such a mild case. I just want this to be done for all of us, want to help things go back to whatever normal was, and want to keep myself out of the hospital.

He's 62 years old, no previous physical conditions, but he didn't get any of the vaccines because he fell down the anti-vax/covid conspiracy hole. My uncle had to literally drag him to the hospital because he refused to get help. He knew he had covid and wouldn't admit it, putting not only himself but my 84 year old grandma and my two uncles in danger. One of them (the one who ended up dragging him to the ER) has fybromialgia, so his health is also incredibly compromised because of that. Yet he risked his life for my dad. Luckily, no one else ended up as bad as he is right now because they all got vaccinated back in the day, and only got infected but had very few symptoms. As far as the situation with my dad goes, doctors have been honest with us, and although it is not impossible for my dad to get out of this, he's in a very very critical state. Because of this, I've barely been able to eat or sleep, anxiety is eating me alive and I've started to notice how this is affecting my moods. I can barely get a hold of myself. I'm extremely angry and sad and resentful and tired. All at the same time. I've started to snap at people, and I have the constant need to scream until my throat breaks. I literally feel like I'm going insane. I've read about his complications and how fucked they are, and I realize that doctors can only do so much and chances of him making it out are very slim. Everyone around me is trying to be supportive, and say things like \"don't loose your faith\", \"as long as he's alive there's a chance\", and YES, there's obviously still hope but it's honestly maddening. Not even the doctors know what the hell is going to happen because that's what covid does. One day they're fine, and literally hours later they're dying. How am I not supposed to loose my shit? The waiting is killing me. Anyone going/has gone through a similar situation? Any advice? Please help.",

I had COVID back in November, and at 6 months after infection, I got my antibody levels tested and was surprised to see I still had antibodies. My numerical result (on a <ORG> Elecsys test testing for Spike Protein Antibodies) was 246. Two months later I tested again (I was curious about rate of decline) and was at 226. I'm feeling like it's probably time to get vaccinated despite my previous infection, but I'm really curious to see how much higher vaccine-level antibodies are than my current levels. I know individual levels can vary and that we still don't know what antibody levels = immunity, but it would still be interested to know the common ranges seen after vaccination. Has anyone else gotten a test for the spike protein antibodies post vaccination? Would love to hear your results if you feel comfortable sharing. P.S. I'm basing my vaccination decisions off expert recommendations and studies surrounding reinfection rates/previous immunity vs vaccination immunity, etc. not off this Reddit thread - don't worry. :) But as someone who has a little bit of nervousness around taking any medication and who loves data, this type of information gives me more confidence in my decision.",

Theres no enough scientific evidence to support this, theyre doing it because we dont have enough vaccines and Im not sure how this is going to affect the immunity response. It makes me so angry because the government negotiated the vaccines with several pharmaceuticals since last year but this companies are delaying the vaccines supplies and we have received a minimum of what we purchased. And I think this happens in other third world countries. Is so unfair to see how wealthy nations are already applying boosters meanwhile here we have nothing!

I'm classed as at risk and spent much of my childhood in hospitals which is why I've been extra careful. Due to circumstances with my anxiety preventing me from working, I'm moving in with my elderly grandmother where I intend to remain cautious. My grandmother still goes out, eats at pubs, goes to church, does not wear a mask in a taxi, etc. But I still have added anxiety about infecting her if I were to catch the virus. Onto the main topic: My best friends are getting married in October (6 weeks from now) and I've known about this for some time. They just asked me to confirm if I will attend the wedding as a bridesmaid. I haven't see a friend in almost 2 years at this point and get anxiety answering the door for deliveries, going to the shop, etc. There will be up to 40 guests in a room with a maximum capacity of 40. I live in the UK, so cases are fairly high and nothing like mask wearing or social distancing are mandated now. Logically I know that this is a high risk scenario, emotionally I am super anxious that if I don't go, I will lose my friends. I'm so anxious that I haven't even been able to reply with a yes or no or to share my concerns. What would you do? TLDR: I have bad anxiety, haven't seen friends in 2 years, live with elderly grandmother, and have been invited to be a bridesmaid at my best friends wedding. I get anxious just answering the door for deliveries or when going shopping for food. I'm also anxious I'll lose my friend if I can't go. Help!",

I'm sick of this insipid messaging that society considers it a worse fate to exist in a body like mine than to be severely ill.

He took a 3rd test while having a high fever again still negative. We alerted his work and mine and of course they required another test so we actually booked 2 (1rapid and 1 \"cultured\" ) the rapid tests were both negative AGAIN but we have to wait till Monday for those results. His fever and other symptoms literally comes and goes at random and it's stressing us out. I have only had a slit cough and feeling flushed but that's it no fever no nothing. At what point do we trust the test results and stop freaking out or are the results wrong and do we stay quarantined for another week?

I live with my parents, one of whom has had historic lung issues, is 71, and also probably high risk. We're all fully vaccinated. My goal, really, throughout all this is to reduce my chance of *infection* to near zero. It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid. I know being vaccinated my chances of hospitalization and death are low, that's not really what I'm worried about. I'm a wind player, and theoretically have an orchestra concert coming up mid september. I'm in Oregon where cases are pretty out of control. From what research I've seen, playing a wind instrument is essentially identical to just talking in terms of risk factor. So that's fine. Assuming no precautions are taken, that'll be something like 20 people within 15 feet of me, possibly unvaccinated, unmasked, not particularly well ventilated space, for multiple hours. To me that is very clearly an untenable risk, even though I am vaccinated. I guess the first gut check - am I already being over-cautious in thinking that? If I'm right that that is way too risky. What precautions would be reasonable to ask for? If everyone is vaccinated, all non-wind players are masked, and I'm 6 feet away from everyone else, that's about as many mitigating factors as possible - and I honestly can't tell if that's enough to be safe or not. It's still being unmasked in a room full of people for hours, doing an activity that for me involves a lot of deep breaths. I suspect, on one hand, I may be too cautious in thinking those measures wouldn't be enough? and the other hand I can't help but shake the fear that it won't work out okay",

Looking back, I can't say for sure, but I feel like I had trouble sleeping the last time, too. I think I wrote it off at the time as being unrelated because everyone has trouble sleeping sometimes. I've heard some anecdotal accounts of similar difficulty falling asleep after the COVID vaccine and flu shots, but I don't remember anything about it in the <ORG> or <ORG> clinical trials, but I could have overlooked that if it was mentioned because I was more focused on things like fever and gastrointestinal upset. I'm not especially concerned, except maybe about the lack of sleep making that general gross feeling worse or last longer, so I'm considering taking a benadryl or something to knock me out. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.",

I've been vaccinated, I've socially distanced, and I've fallen into the deepest pit of depression I've ever experienced. I've been genuinely wondering whether life was worth living. So I got it into my head to say screw it, I'm going on a cruise. I'm doing all sorts of research into it and for the first time in so long I felt happy and excited for something. Then I read that the CDC says people with asthma, which includes me, shouldnt be on a cruise even if we are vaccinated. And that the cruise line is requiring masks all over the place. And now a part of me doesn't even want to go. I'm so sick of this fucking pandemic. This is not life. This is not ending, and it needs to fucking end. I don't want to live like this anymore. I want to just go back to my life, to start enjoying things again. Get up, work, go to sleep. That's a miserable existence. A part of me does just want to die at this point, the world fucking sucks.",

We're both fully vaccinated and Paris (where we'd spend most of our time) seems to be doing well with vaccination rates and requiring vaccines to do most activities. However, we planned this trip in mid-June when things seemed like they were getting better-- now, with Delta, it's feeling a bit riskier to attempt international travel. My question is, which factors would you weigh the heaviest if you were thinking about traveling? Right now the thing I'm most worried about is getting a positive test before returning to the US and having to quarantine in Paris-- that would be a whole mess. But I don't know if that's reason enough to cancel the whole trip, and after a year and a half of being stuck at home, I desperately want to go. (For the record, I'm young, healthy, work from home, and don't have regular contact with unvaccinated or immunocompromised people.)",

I know this is relatively \"recent\" and my antibodies shouldn't have waned too much, but I'll be working in a school from September. Luckily it's a small private school and masks are mandatory, but my students are very young and can't wear them very well. I live with my parents, and my mom works in a hospital and my dad is very high risk. They will both be in the first groups officially eligible for a booster shot but I don't think that will come until late September. Furthermore, I'm a former smoker with possible asbestos exposure in the past, so while my lungs are fine for now they are very vulnerable to damage. Getting this job has disqualified me from Medicaid, so I won't have health insurance for the next month either. I'm terrified of catching Delta and 1. suffering permanent damage, 2. incurring huge medical debt, and 3. passing it to my parents before they can get a booster. My dad would not survive a COVID infection. If you were in my situation, do you think it would be worth \"sneaking\" a third dose of pfizer or even a booster of J&amp;J for extra protection? I will be double-masking at work with a KN95 and surgical mask, but schools are such a high-risk environment that I don't feel comfortable even with that.",

Having had two doses of <ORG> (just about - I got my second dose on the same day I think I contracted Covid), my symptoms have been fairly mild and I have nearly completely recovered. However (and here is my problem), I am due to fly to Canada from England on the 3rd September, which will require a pre-departure and post-arrival test. Even though I will no longer be infectious, I am seriously concerned that I might still be testing positive for Covid and thus be barred from flying. Has anyone got any information on how long it takes to finally test negative, particularly for someone who is double vaccinated? I have found some information saying it can often be as much as a a month, however others dispute this in certain cases. Many thanks!",

I had heard that it was typically recommended to chemo patients, as the treatments can destroy your smell and taste in a similar way that Covid does. I lost my smell and taste in Nov of last year, and it's been very difficult to deal with ever since. You should be able to find it at Walmart or Walgreens, and most pharmacies should carry them. You don't need a prescription to buy them, either. I personally have been taking it for about a week now, and I have noticed some changes. My smell isn't totally back, but I can tell that it's improving. I'm wondering if I'll have to take a stinger dose seeing as it's been so long. We'll just have to wait and see. Just wanted to share with others currently struggling to find something to help. If you Google alpha lipoic acid, the first thing that comes up is smell loss do due upper respiratory infections.

The first night I felt mental confusion, possible onset of mania? and a strange metallic taste in my mouth. The next day I woke up and my calf muscle was spasming uncontrollably (went to er, was fine). The day after I woke up with dry mouth and my face/body were numb. I called the ambulance(said I was fine). Then for the next two weeks I suffered from panic attacks andchest discomfort, it was dark psychologically. I also woke up in the middle of the night and my neck was completely stiff one night. I am terrified of the side effects and what my anxiety will do to me after this shot.

I thought being vaccinated would lend some type of protection I havent done anything too crazy (no trips no parties nothing) the craziest thing I did is probably going to the gym and taking off my mask, its not even a full gym. Were socially distanced. Yesterday I woke up with a killer sore throat, I went to gettested results were negative. Today I wake up with no sore throat but gradually started sneezing so I thought might as well take another test so I got an at home test. Clearly negative on the test. I dont know what Im doing at this point and I dont know how to handle this logically. I booked a PCR test for Friday night, Im thinking by then it would show on a home test if Im really positive. Im 26 years old and yes havw both shots so I thought I wouldnt need to worry about breakthrough infections but Im seeing more and more of it. At work people are coughing and sneezing around me. We all wear masks but Im wondering how many people are walking around thinking they have allergies when its covid. This is a special type of hell. Ive had sore throats before this pandemic and they went away; but this time it turned into sneezing and runny noses. What do I do, do I wait a couple days and test again? I have no other symptoms besides the sneezing. No fever nothing.",

However, the wedding will be attended by 100+ people from all over the country and other countries. With cases rising and hospitals being overrun, I explained they should implement a vaccine-only rule for guests, with proof of vaccination sent beforehand and rapid tests at the door. I got pushback because they \"can't\" tell people they can only attend if they're vaccinated. I told them they can since it's their wedding. Their plan is to have \"spaced seating\" and \"strongly suggest\" that people be vaccinated and have everyone wear masks. If there's anything this pandemic has taught us, it is that people will lie and do whatever they want to. Of course the proof can be faked, but it's still better than nothing. Furthermore, it's unrealistic to expect everyone to keep masks on the whole time at a wedding where people will be eating, drinking, dancing, having conversations, taking pictures, and trying to hear each other over music. They're the ones choosing to go through with an indoor wedding during a pandemic, but I'm being treated as if I'm completely unreasonable. It seems extremely irresponsible to me. Having a bunch of people attend an indoor wedding and then fly back to their respective homes. I'm vaccinated but I would still very much prefer to not catch this virus, minimal symptoms or not. It's like I have to accept possibly getting the virus for this wedding and I don't know what to do.",

I am vaccinated so Im not worried about *getting* Covid but I dont want to delay the surgery if I get it and test positive for weeks after. Its not life threatening surgery but there is a VERY SMALL chance that what is being removed could be something bad. My friend has had a real shit time with their wedding (it was rescheduled twice because of covid already) and I feel immense guilt. I already cant go to the bach. party but I may have to pull out of the wedding shower now, too. If all goes well with the surgery I should still be able to be in the wedding in the fall. Am I over reacting? Should I just go? Most people there should be vaccinated but who knows",

I'm almost waiting for them to say that they've got 500K+cases per day. It's only getting worse and take this with a grain of salt but I feel like the vaccinations are so slow that there's no way we can beat this until it burns out on its own. Why can't people just listen in the damn first place?! We were so close to the end. So so close. Now, another year with masks, lockdowns all over the world, and avoiding doing pretty much everything except taking a walk from time to time, or going to appointments. I'm so so tired. I lost the first few years of my 20s to this. I lost my sense of taste/smell for 6 months to this ! I lost my appetite and so much of my mental and physical health to this.. I cancelled everything I cared about and stayed almost completely alone for almost TWO YEARS NOW for this! I don't want to sound uncaring, but I want to be selfish too. I want to enjoy something that's not a nature hike or clapping because we got something a little extra in our grocery delivery. Therapy isn't working for this. I don't want to keep coping with \"this is the way it is.\" I'm not even looking for normalcy. I'm looking for a reason to live anymore. To put up with the lockdowns and quarantining for another year. Booster shots possibly every 6-9 months - I just can't! I'm so freaking miserable and I feel like I have so little to be happy about anymore.",

While my parents are normally pretty reasonable, for whatever reason they bought into all the propaganda against the Covid vaccines. While I wanted to get it and was eligible months ago, I wasn't allowed. They seemed so very genuinely worried that it would hurt me, and it was emotionally taxing to keep arguing against them. They wouldn't listen. Since I don't leave the house much, I figured it would be okay to give up. I agreed to wait until FDA approval, then get it. In a case of the worst possible timing ever, though, just as a vaccine receives full approval, there's been an outbreak at my father's workplace. A big one. He tested negative four days ago, and hasn't been to work for unrelated reasons since then, but I'm still scared. I've asked him to mask, isolate, even open a window and he's said no. Every time he coughs within earshot, I want to claw my eyes out. So, while I've finally got a vaccine appointment for 2 days from now, I'm worried it's too late. I'm taking my temperature constantly, checking my breathing, washing my hands like crazy, wiping stuff down... I don't know what else to do. And I keep ruminating over how, if I do get sick, people will think I deserve it since I'm not vaccinated. They'll think I'm just one of the idiots. But I swear I didn't want to be, I really would've gotten it day 1 if I weren't so scared of confrontation. I guess this isn't much more than a vent. Logically I know I'll probably be okay. Even if I get it, I'm 29. A little overweight, out of shape, but no other health issues. But I just needed to say, somewhere, that this isn't entirely my fault. I'm not stupid, just... cowardly. And I'll be vaccinated soon. I just hope it isn't too late.",

Im neurodivergent and living without a schedule since covid has been difficult but isolation is a whole new level of chaos for my brain. I cant bring myself to do anything other than shower and brush my teeth and even thats not happening daily if were being honest. I cant even begin to deal with texts from friends who already want to make plans after my quarantine is over. I dont think they understand where I am mentally (which I dont blame them for, Ive been pretty shut down since Sunday). I dont know if Ill be able to just return to society after this. Im mad at myself for not being as careful and for relying too heavily on the vaccine for protection. Im grateful that its clearly working because Im not hospitalized, but more and more people I know are having breakthrough cases and its getting to me. Not looking for advice. Maybe some solidarity with others who have gone through this / are going through this? Thanks for letting me vent.",

Mild cough, mild sore throat, thats it. So we got tested 8 days ago. The rapid test came back negative so we moved on and treated our symptoms like a cold. Well we just got a call from the lab with our PCR results and we are all positive. Weve only been around 2 people unvaccinated, all the rest have been vaccinated, but my youngest has been going to daycare still. And we still wear masks in public. I just feel horrible. Worried I could have passed it on to someone, feel bad about deceiving everyone. And at this point, were 10 days past first symptom and all our symptoms are gone or improved. Do I tell those we were with even though theres nothing we can do now? How do I get over these feelings of guilt?",

I know it takes a few weeks for immunity to develop and you need both doses to be protected from Delta, but does the vaccine the day before infection make any difference at all when it comes to likelihood of severe disease?

Immediately i started panicking. I thought it would be a one or two times but she kept going. At this time i switched from surgical mask to my KN95. She also was burping A LOT, which maybe what she has is heartburn or something cuz who burps that much at 10am. i work 2 hours and ended up leaving early cuz i couldnt take it anymore. It was just sniffling which could be allergies but i was PANICKING. she was in another cublicle, we never talked or shared anything. We just were in the same room. I am vaccinated. What is the likelyhood of a exposure? or sure i just not worry about it? like people sniffle? she clearly doesnt have manners cuz she kept burping so maybe she is just one of those people who clean their nose a lot. im freaking out",

I've told him this, and although he's not playing it as safe in his own life, he respects it. However, last night at the end of the date, he wanted to kiss, and while I said no due to having to social distance, it prompted me to think...what would the future of us dating look like? Obviously, physical touch is part of a relationship and idk how long he'll wait to even be able to hug me. Do I ask him to reconsider his safety precautions? Do we both get tested before we hangout? What's fair to ask of him? I really wanna make it work, but protecting my family is important too. Oh, and a little more info, we're both vaccinated, but he's going on without a mask, and into pretty public, crowded places. I still wear my mask everywhere but the outdoors and avoid busy, crowded places. The only people my family would be comfortable with me having around without any precautions is someone who is living similarly. (They do like this guy tho, despite his different safety choices).",

However it suddenly turns out one other person, let's call them Person-X, is unvaccinated. Person-X claimed that the vaccine was only available when they were away from home for a week as an excuse. But that is wrong, it's easy to get a vaccine where we live. I already have 2 doses. I didn't say that because I didn't want to start an argument. Person-X has earlier said they did not care about the vaccine so I think this is the true cause. I don't want to spend hours inside a relatively small room with Person-X now because it's not safe enough. I currently value having good health a lot. It's just not worth it to me. :/ I don't want to be rude to the group and let them down after all this planning. Especially as Person-X claimed the vaccine was not available. How do I express concerns, and say that I don't want to show up anymore? We have a group chat I can use.

How can I avoid getting sick? He is being respectful and is wearing a mask anytime hes in the shared space and is wiping things down. Ive disinfected most of anything that would be touched, and Ive also turned on the ceiling fan, AC, and cracked the windows open (I said I would cover the electric bill). What else can I do as a precaution. Is it likely for me to be exposed to the virus anytime I use the kitchen? There are no windows over there or ways to air it out, really: 2. Do I need to self isolate? We both go to the same university and he said student health would reach out to me with info but they have not sent me anything yet. I have no symptoms. 3. Does anyone have testimonies of similar situations where you had to live with someone who got COVID? Did you end up getting sick? What did you do? Let me know, and thanks for the help!",

I realize most positive cases don't require hospitalization, but just curious as to the treatment options available to keep one safe (besides vaccines)",

I hung out with my girlfriend on Monday and we made out for a bit but only hung out for about an hour or two.

I've been tense the past couple of weeks worried about COVID exposure, so I was positive it was just my TMJ acting up. Hadn't slept well then I woke up today with a vaguely scratchy throat. Which, is not uncommon for me, because I sleep with a fan blowing in my face all night. But I just started crying at this point. I'm vaccinated. I've been doing my best to keep safe. I had lunch with a friend yesterday and I think it would devastate me if I got her sick. But my symptoms aren't common COVID symptoms. But the more I think about them, the more I feel like, I feel them. And then more symptoms pop up. Do I feel vaguely achy or is this the anxiety? I feel hot, but take my temperature and it's normal. I feel short of breath, but I use my oximeter and my levels are fine. I start googling and panicking over and over. I try to distract myself, which makes my symptoms so much less. But soon the anxiety creeps up again and I spiral. I feel so exhausted now. I thought I was doing well with my COVID anxiety but between these events I attended and people in my office testing positive, I went back to square one for a bit.",

I live 7 hours from campus and she swears there are testing centers available in all locations. I called my local community college and they arent offering proctored tests this year due to the pandemic. Told my professor, no response. I have bad anxiety and I literally do not go into buildings hardly ever since the pandemic started. I am terrified of going into a testing center during the fall and winter just to take a test. When covid cases will be increasing during the winter months more than likely. The two 4 year universities in my area are already talking about going online only this semester. So I honestly feel like Ill have nowhere to take these exams. To me this professor is coming off as insensitive and uncaring, and rather tone deaf regarding the pandemic. This should not be allowed. Any advice is appreciated.. mainly just wanted to rant. P.S. to add, the school I go to has technology that allows them to proctor tests from home. But apparently this isnt good enough for my professor.",

My mom is vaccinated with J&amp;J since March and my dad is unvaccinated. They both had moderate symptoms, went to the doctor and were prescribed a few things. My mom is feeling almost normal again and she seems pretty fine. My dad is doing better than he was, but I don't think he's quite back to normal compared to how quickly my mom bounced back. When I found out they both had it, I decided to stay in my room, upstairs, because I was in a position to do so and I really didn't want to take any risks. I had a limited amount of groceries up here that I have been eating, but I'm almost out, am probably eating too little, and it's really starting to get to me mentally. I went downstairs earlier, masked, because I realize it has been over 10 days and they're both clearly improving though my dad is still coughing quite a bit and lethargic. I'm too freaked out to do it again, really. I'm fully vaccinated but the risk was still there so I have been doing everything in my power to avoid contact. Even being in the kitchen knowing that my dad had been in there a few hours prior makes me uncomfortable. I really just want to eat a hot, normal, meal. Realistically, am I safe to go downstairs and cook food? I just don't want to take any risk.

I reached my 21 days a few days ago and Im wondering two things: Is there any evidence of better protection if I wait a little longer to get my second dose? AND Is there any evidence that says mixing doses is more effective then two of the same vaccine? (Im in Canada weve been doing that here for a while and a few of my family and friends have had mixed doses) Id appreciate if you can provide proof if youve seen any. I would prefer to get my second shot as <ORG> because (despite what people may say) Ive seen more people have more side effects with the <ORG> and I really dont want to deal with that HOWEVER if its better protection for me to mix I will. Be kind, getting vaccinated was difficult for me and waiting to get the second dose which tends to cause more symptoms and potential for serious side effects to appear is nerveracking",

It's been difficult to quarantine for the rest of my family as we live in a 2bd/1ba apt with a 1.5 yo. So my question is - how long must my wife and child also quarantine before they are cleared? What if they continue to test negative throughout the next few days until I'm presenting no clear symptoms? More context - my wife and daughter both tested negative the following Sunday 08/29. Wife has presented mild symptoms somewhat similar to mine (sore throat, headache, etc) a day after the PCR test. Both my wife and I have had our first shot of the mRNA vaccine (<ORG> and <ORG> respectively). She continues to be okay and not worsen like I have. We will take another test by the end of this week - if it comes back negative and no present symptoms for all members of the family, are we clear? Hopefully that was clear and concise - trying to figure this out has been the opposite lol",

One of my good buddies just informed the group chat last night that he tested positive for Covid four days ago (Thursday), and showed flu-like symptoms at the beginning of the week (Monday). He said that he is feeling better, and by the time we leave for the trip, which is this Thursday it will be 10 days he's been in isolation and according to the CDC, he should be cleared to resocialize and therefore not miss the trip. I know there are a lot of factors and it's hard to determine when it might be safe to be around others, but that time frame still seems very tight. For the record, everyone in our party is fully vaccinated, so there is some protection. But we will be in tight quarters for a few days, and I'll be in close contact with family for some time after this trip. We are all getting tested, and he said he will as well. There is a light understanding that if he tests positive that he won't go, but he has been kind of forward stating that there is a high probability he will even if he is \"Not Contagious\". Which makes me feel like he might try to attend regardless. The fact that it's a breakthrough infection is making me feel a little overly cautious about wanting to attend. Overall, is that timeline a little too tight or am I overthinking things? \\------------------------------------------- **TL;DR** \\- A friend had a breakthrough infection less than a week ago, showing flu-like symptoms. He's feeling better, but would like to still attend a trip we leave for this week, which would mark exactly 10 days he's been in isolation since showing symptoms but would be 7 days after he's tested positive. Is that timeframe too tight, and am I overthinking about not attending the trip?",

Apparently he got it at school after they started a week ago. He got tested today as the school had been getting reports on several other students testing positive. He had his confirmation yesterday and I as well as other family members were present. Which has me a bit worried (My family and importantly my grandparents who were there are fully vaccinated) yet I am still worried, especially for my brother. I am worried he will feel like this is his fault. The whole situation is just really stressful. I live in another city and traveled home last night (wearing a mask and keeping my distance to other people) but I am still worried about having spread the virus as I took a train home. I have scheduled a test for myself tomorrow and am really hoping I test negative. I live quite far away and they are swamped with informing the rest of the attendees about how to proceed. Luckily most of the guests (with the exception of three teenagers) were vaccinated. There weren't that many guests though just 13 - 15. However I just feel stressed and worried about this whole affair. Wondering if I should reach out to my brother to let him know that it is not his fault or if I should just let him be and keep communication restricted to my parents until he feels better (He has light symptoms for now). Apologies for any spelling mistakes, english is my second language.",

We took them off to eat and drink but wore them for everything else. I felt SO awkward and out of place. We also decided mostly not to dance because the dance floor was very crowded and a few inches from each other and it made me nervous. At some points we were literally the only people at the tables and stuck out like sore thumbs. The worst was the judgmental comments. Most people were fine and just stared at us curiously and did not say anythingone person (an old high school friend) respectfully asked my level of comfort with chatting and elbow bumped my husband hello. However one woman kept making comments like I cant hear anything youre saying with that fabric on your face and nice to SORT OF see you.

Im a med phobe. Like getting my tetanus booster was a huge deal...really... Reasons I got vaccinated. And it is a few reasons I will lump into one. Stats prove the vaccine works period. It works. It may not prevent Covid but it will damn sure 95 times out of 100 keep you from dying alone on a vent or being hospitalized alone. I am also still hopeful that vaccinated folks spread less. I know thats somewhat still up in the air. My experience. Shot one. Arm hurt. And I mean cant lift it kind of hurt. It was bad. But that was it. Nothing else, no fever, chills, headache, nothing.

His mom (my mom's sister) texted all of her siblings today saying that they are asking that everyone who attends the wedding be vaccinated since there will be high risk people there. My uncle's responses included the following: -I'm not going to the wedding -That is an insane thing to request -I'm sorry you have been brainwashed -vaccinated people spread the virus more than unvaccinated people -the vaccines infect you with the virus and make you a carrier Mind you that my aunt and her husband are also both healthcare professionals. I guess I mostly just needed to rant, but it's also extremely upsetting to hear things like this. We've been hearing crap like this from anti-vaxxers all along, but it hits differently when it's coming directly from someone you know, and someone you're related to on top of that. I don't plan on getting involved in this argument whatsoever, but I truly just don't understand how and why people think like this. How can we ever return to normal when there are so many people who believe these kinds of things, and refuse to listen to facts/reasoning/arguments/anything?",

And I just feel like high paying office jobs are gonna be online forever because most people don't like going too the office it seems. And same deal for therapists because of the crazy amount of money they will save not having an office. Right now I've been trying too find a therapist for months and I've had close too 0 luck. The few that I found charge insane amounts like 150 a session which I could never afford. And I'm not very hopeful that office jobs and in person therapy will be a thing after the delta variant",

He repeated a few of the tag-lines that I see floating around the web: spike protein, \"stays in the arm\", bringing up clips of doctors on some weird video hosting site called \"rumble\" (like not even dailymotion is puttin up with that?) and linking Instagram screen caps of excerpts of, yes, real studies but not good, accepted studies. Talking about co-morbidities and about how hes not responsible for other peoples health and talking about \"2%\" rates. I dont want to provide the direct articles and videos we were discussing cause I dont want to become part of the problem by accident. Now... I know vaccines work. But I dont know how to eloquently explain this in a concrete fashion without shoving scifi and video game references all through it, to the point it loses cohesion. How do you start convincing people that... well I mean all of society functions of off science. If \"the gubmint\" was using science to \"trick us out of Gods love\", or whatever, jew-lasers or the craziness they say was true, then frickin planes wouldnt fly. Boats wouldnt float. We wouldnt have nuclear reactors or submarines. The proof is in the pudding: we scrutinize each other and \"the pack\" finds the truth through consensus. Like were talking about the very fabric of our culture, the basic trust of our own SPECIES. I tried to put things in context, explain and provide OLD resources pre-pandemic to sway his mind but he isnt being receptive. How do you start breaking this down for someone? Like these people arent DUMB a lot of the time, were talking high school graduated and some college level education. How do you break through the brainwash barrier and start talking sense to people?",

The other employees are pretty lax with masks, eat and drink freely, etc since we are all in the same bubble and don't really go anywhere (and when they have, they've gotten tested before and after). I've also started being more relaxed now that I'm vaccinated. I don't panic if my one! mask isn't so snug my face hurts. I took off my mask indoors! to eat lunch with everyone. It's so liberating and it feels so good, and I feel like Delta is so contagious that normal surgical masks probably wouldn't prevent infection anyway even if we were all 100% diligent. But after a year and a half of driving myself insane, I'm struggling with the guilt of relaxing. I feel like I'm being irresponsible. Is this normal? Am I a bad person or stupid for relaxing a bit? I guess I just need reassurance, please tell me this is okay (or that it's not and I need to be more (responsible).",

I'm having a hard time figuring out the best time to test. It's hard to find an open testing slot at the few places that test in person (for $120 a pop).

She stood at the door with it open, and my dad stopped and never came within 10 feet of her. Probably closer to 15 feet. He sat the bags down and quickly turned and walked back to the car. They were both wearing masks. He was probably within 15-20 feet for like 15 seconds. Im just mortified he mustve gotten it somehow. I wish she didnt walk outside and part of me is mad at her for it, but I know she just didnt think of that and I shouldnt be upset with her.

So far I've just found some anecdotes from folks who have done it. I know there are instances of people in Europe mixing <ORG> (similar to JnJ) with their second dose being either <ORG> or <ORG> and in Canada loads of people are mixing and have mixed <ORG> and <ORG>. I also read that there won't be studies about mixing vaccines for a long time. I have talked to a doctor and an epidemiologist. The doctor said go for it it's fine and the epidemiologist said there isn't guidance from the CDC and they don't recommend it. I have been exceptionally worried about getting covid as I live with 5 other people and have many types of anxiety including health anxiety. I really don't want to catch a virus that affects my breathing as it would trigger panic attacks for me. It's been almost 6 months since I got JnJ and I know the efficacy is waning. With all that being said, I know users on Reddit probably shouldn't recommend anything like this, but I am mostly hoping to find some anecdotes of people that have tried mixing and what their experience was like. Even some theories about mixing the different vaccines would help me feel better too. I'm at a point where I'm more worried about the outcome of catching covid without much help from the vaccine I got rather than what would happen if I got a different type of vaccine 6 months later.",

His concern is less about any side effects or any conspiracy, and more along the lines that it is not necessary and should not be be mandated on individuals. His view is that for his age group (30-40), the risks from Covid are negligible and not worse than an ordinary flu. I would like to show him scientific accredited research disproving his position. It does not need to be a scientific paper, but at least a view that is accredited to a recognized bona fide source. In particular I would like to prove the following (all specific to his age group): 1) There is a materially higher risk of contracting Covid than the flu. 2) There is materially higher risk of an adverse health effect (eg significant, versus an unpleasant cold or flu) from Covid than the flu. 3) There is a materially higher risk of being a host and thereby transmitting to a third party Covid by being unvaccinated.

She attempted to pay her family members hundreds of dollars not to get the vaccine and spends hours doing \"her own research\" on conspiracy theories. Currently she is Covid positive. And not only is that frustrating in its own as I was exposed to her indirectly and am now visiting my parents in my hometown and feel incredibly guilty for potentially putting them at risk, but her smug attitude is making me want to snap. She is bragging about how <ORG> is helping SO much while sharing anti-mask posts on Facebook and continuing to call people sheep ***(ironic, as she's the one literally treating herself with medicine designed for barnyard animals).*** So I know it's not nice to wish this on anyone but I don't have much patience or empathy left in me for people dragging out this pandemic. I don't feel bad for her especially since she is GUILT free for continuing to go into public maskless and Covid positive. And I resent her deeply for putting her son and myself in such an uncomfortable position. My family never wants to meet her and I never want to see her again but my boyfriend is her only son and family and it is an incredibly difficult position to be in.",

I didn't know the symptoms from the second vaccine would be this rough for me. I was out of the house from 9am-5pm (and didn't sleep well that night either). I couldn't sit still in classes and writing was so difficult because I had no strength in me. Wearing a mask made more heat build up around my face and head, causing more pressure. I took so much tylenol (2 tablets every four hours) because my fever kept coming back every hour and it was so bad that I felt like I was going to pass out but kept pushing through. My appetite decreased immensely because of the fevers (102F) so I ate less than 500 calories for the past two days. Driving back home was a hassle because I couldn't even completely push down on the gas and brakes, I was drained and aching. My entire body felt like there were sharp needles jabbing at my skin. Taking a mere step was just agonizing. Finally, I got to rest when I came home but still feel bleh today as well and am currently in bed. Probably slept 18 hours total. My symptoms were worse because my body got no rest and I also didn't sleep well the night I got my vaccine (which was monday evening). People were informing me it wasn't that bad for them and that I should just get the second shot, but I shouldn't have listened! Everyone's body reacts differently. Anyways, moral of this - please rest and take the second vaccine on your days off just in case if you haven't yet, don't suffer like me. Other than that, WOO-HOO I'M FULLY VACCINATED!",

My wife and I are retired and live a guilty debt-free and comfortable lifestyle in what feels like a fortress mentality. Apart from some lighter interludes- like my wife telling me its like living with a different person after I decided to shave off my beard and moustache- in a fit of WTF- I truly have learned the significance of living one day at a time. I can just feel myself getting unbelievably anxious when I think of the future. What if covid and the lockdowns NEVER end? What if- and I see nothing to refute it- the whole thing NEVER ends? What if we can NEVER live out our dream of overseas travel, holding our wonderful grandkids again, etc etc. We have a saying that acceptance is the key and I know thats right, but until and if I truly get to that place of acceptance, it feels like Im living in a twilight world, a seperate reality.",

After I got the second coronavirus vaccine(<ORG>) on the 19th of June I started to have strong heart palpitations and trouble breathing for a day and a half. That all subsided but later after 13-14 days I started to get the same symptoms that persisted for 5 days. My EKG test was also abnormal when I decided to test it and I'm going to go visit a cardiologist around October. I quickly got brain fog minutes after having the same symptoms on the 2nd of August. Right now I still have brain fog where I can't think properly/imagine properly and I'm feeling extremely angry/depressed from having this interfere with my life.

Three days after we landed the Governor asked people to come anymore. It was too late to cancel at this point, so I made a decision to avoid crowds, do take out or eat outside as much possible. I had the people of Hawaii not wanting us in the back of my mind throughout the trip, and I still feel some guilt for going. I get back from the trip about 4 days ago. I live with my parents and thought it would be smart to do a soft-quarantine away from them (i.e. generally stay in my room and wear a mask around them if i do have to interact). I'm getting tested tomorrow. I know that I'm probably being way too careful than most people would. I learn that my friend is on her way to Seattle on an impromptu trip. Not even a week after we return from Hawaii. She didn't care that she might be spreading the virus around. why do I care and still continue to lose out on valuable experiences? Should i just stop giving an eff too? I know that its so hard to know what the right thing to do is in these times and I might be too risk averse.",

Even a cold could render here in hospital at the moment. Do not give advice to people you have no idea about it is dangerous. If your vax awesome! Just be considerate if you find you have been around someone who has tested positive. Get tested around 3-5 days after exposure and before getting a neg test wear a mask if you have to be around people you dont know their medical history or vaccination status. Anyone who tells you differently is misinformed and a danger to those who are not privileged enough to have a healthy body.",

However he is eating and able to talk but gets very short of breath. He's refused so far and we as the family know it is due to the posts and stuff he has read about the drs wanting to kill patients etc etc. The drs are unwilling to talk to him about the treatment and the pros/cons as they dont want to mess him up mentally. As the family we have been asked to talk to him, however I am getting rather emotional and angry that he's refused. I just don't know what we can say to him that would help him understand his situation and that if he does refuse his chances of leaving the hospital are reduced without the treatment.",

He was over-weight (not obese), diabetic, and has had asthma most of his life. His underlying health conditions placed him at higher risk for complications and I am sure that he was aware of this and yet, he did not get the vaccine. I was floored when I learned that he was unvaccinated because to me it was a no-brainer type decision. The last time we spoke I asked if he was vaccinated and he said \"I wish had.\" He was happier and more hopeful in the last two years than he has ever been and was engaged with a wedding date in the spring of 2022. He made his last car payment on the same day that he tested positive. He always came across as so intelligent and confident. However, after getting sick and fearing that he was going to die, sounded so scared and defeated. Last weekend he crashed and was placed on a vent. He continued to crash, went into multi-organ failure, began to bleed out, and became septic. At that point I knew that if he survived that he would be in such horrible condition that he would have no quality of life. I am relieved, given the circumstances, that he died. But he suffered so much over the last 34 days that I would not wish it on anyone. If you have something to live for get vaccinated! Trusting your immune system or thinking that you can get through it is foolish. Don't throw everything that you love away.",

I can't force my friends to be less risky. I'm so lonely and sad all the time. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm finding myself receding and isolating myself more and more.

After doing research, I realized that lots of people have had similar problems &amp; worse (heart inflammation, etc). Eventually, I got really anxious and didnt end up getting my second dose. Even though I mask up when I do go out and social distance as much as possible, I still fear that Ill catch covid. Since the delta variant lowers the efficacy of the vaccines, I can imagine how much less protection I have being partially vaccinated. I fear for not only myself, but my mother &amp; other family members. Most of my friends are not vaccinated &amp; are also skeptical of the vaccine. One of my friends sisters has gotten 2 doses &amp; she developed myocarditis and experienced issues with her period. I know not everyone will have the same experience, but whos to say who will and who wont ? Covid isnt any better either. Lots of people made me feel crazy for getting the vaccine; I was super excited to get it but now Im terrified. Has anyone gone through the same thing? My depression has gotten so bad because Ive been in the house for so long. This pandemic having no end in sight, people dying left and right, the constant fear mongering, life being so dull and the future uncertain... its all too much. I dont understand people who are living life normally as if we are not in a global pandemic. I dont know what to do. Ive been feeling like this since quarantine started (1st year of university) and now Im in my 3rd year. I miss crowds and not having to worry about catching a killer virus every second of my life. I hate wearing masks. I hate having to social distance. I hate not being able to do anything. Almost 2 years of reliving the same day over and over again....",

I'm not sure if what I said got through to her, or if she's doing it to keep her job now, but either way I'm happy. I did end up making a page for her, and I went down the line of articles she sent me pointing out the faults of what some of these antivaxxers were saying (it was easy to find that these people were only out for money). I also showed her the nursing reddit and I think that shocked her a bit maybe? So I'm really happy about that, and I hope she'll be healthy as she gets her 1st and 2nd shot. I keep reading stories of teachers literally dying from this strain, and it worries me that she might not make it until the first jab. :( I'm honestly hoping that our governor makes school online for the time being. Oregon hospitals are being filled up right now, and last I read the ones in Portland are renting morgue trucks for the bodies... Aside from that, my life has been a rollercoaster on a personal level. I got my fiance visa to get married in the UK to be with my partner, but our plans for him to come help me have been thrown out the window (due to UK visitors not being allowed entry into the US), and now I have to do everything on my own. It's super daunting. It's such a strange time right now. Good news that seems to somehow bring around worry just as well. I always try to look on the bright side of things, so even if I have to move everything out on my own, then it's one more challenge on myself to improve! And in the end it's a start of a new life!

So stressed as my sister has a compromised immune system and the doctors have said she is still highly vulnerable, even a cold could render her in hospital. Our dad died of covid in February and a couple of weeks ago her ex partner, my nieces dad killed himself. He was super close to my dad and it hit him really hard. I dont think I have ever felt this much dread of losing someone else. I have two therapists but even having them for support isnt taking helping. I feel at an utter loss and I wish this covid situation would just go away now but know it never will. I know we have to get back to normal but I feel like so many of us who have been traumatised by this pandemic is being forgotten about. So many people just dont care and feel that they dont have to be cautious anymore because they are vaccinated when they are out but dont realised that some people are still not going to be ok if they do catch it even with 2 vaccines. I just dont know how to navigate life anymore. Everything makes me either panic or cry. I am not sure what I am expecting by sharing this but I needed to tell someone how I was feeling and share my experience. I am so stressed. I feel like I have lost my life to this virus and I cant see a way through without more pain on the horizon.",

I can't get my booster yet because they're reserving them for the sickly. (Totally fine to do, by the way!) I have been really careful and considerate this whole pandemic. Hell, I was looking forward to Dragon con, too, but forewent it because of delta and how bad things are, here, in the south.

Anyway, I am conflicted about how safe the festival would be for me. It's outside. But it will be crowded.

Below are the excerpts from his letter that concerned me or that I found conflicting. . . . [w]e are seeing more cases among our students than we did last year. Fortunately, because all of our students are wearing masks in schools, we are not seeing a high rate of spread in the classroom. . . . While your child may not be quarantined when there is a positive case in their classroom, you should be aware that there are likely positive cases in your childs school. Please check your child every day for symptoms . . . . . . As I told you at the start of the school year, our goal is to keep students in school as many days as possible this year . . . My youngest son currently has an upper respiratory infection but tested negative for COVID. My oldest son contracted Hand Foot &amp; Mouth Disease last week, most likely from another child at school (he is well now). While Im thankful theres a mask mandate in our district, Im still concerned that my children are most likely attending school with other children who have COVID-19 and might contract it, especially since they arent eligible to receive the vaccine.

Girls seem to have lost even more interest in dating at this point, dating apps have been very quiet and desolate. Im starting to think that this will be indefinitely our lives now, and its hard to swallow. Im trying my best to keep up with dietary regimens, drinking water, and keeping track of everything while working two jobs, and its just not enough. My depression overtakes every time. I can barely function these days. I dont know what to do about it.",

When we really started too get covid under control before the delta variant life actually was getting better but then once delta came around things got much worse for me. Right now I've lost almost all of my close friends except 1, and so far I haven't gotten very far in finding new close friends and the group I used too hang out with is very covid cautious, and still doesn't even want too hang out outside. With one of my close friends I thought the vaccine would bring us closer and stop her from judging me for enjoying normal life but instead it just tore us apart even further. She recently got mad at me for planning on going too a concert this November in Florida. And economicly work is slowing down a little again because of the delta variant, and I had too move back in with my mom because I had my car broken into twice and totalled 2 times in 4 months. And I really have no hope things will get better, I don't think I'll ever be able too find new close friends again and we're gonna have too wear masks for a very long time again. And in my area people never stopped wearing them when the mandate first got lifted in mid june",

Baby is now 6 months old, and with Delta, weve restricted our bubble to grandparents (also our childcare) only. My office has us on a hybrid WFH model 3 days in office, 2 days remote. Only unvaccinated people are required to wear masks in the office at all times (we had to provide proof of vax cards), but I still mask when moving around the building. Work protocols encourage all digital meetings, but allow in-person conferences with social distancing. So far Ive been able to avoid any in-person meetings, except this one Im required to attend an off-site meeting with members of my office + members of a new agency partner. Its a small gathering at the agencys office 7 people and my team members are vaccinated, but Ill be the only person wearing a mask (the agency said they arent masking in-office. No insight on their office protocols). The meeting will last 2 hours. Not sure how big the conference room is. The agency is providing coffee and breakfast treats (my favorite things) of which I will not partake. I plan to mask the entire time, have as much distance between myself and others as possible, and drive right back home to shower. I guess Im just frustrated by the requirement to attend the meeting in-person AND feeling like Im being overly paranoid. Delta is rampant and I have an infant. Im not going out to do anything fun in general, groceries are delivered, and I resent having to be around people whose vaccine status is unknown to me. I suppose my question isam I worrying too much? Are my feelings justified? Maybe both?",

Voluntary disclosure of vaccination status 2. Vaccinated staff are required to be in office next week 13 Sept I've not shared my vaccination status, and I also think this is asinine to require return to the office during the worst of the pandemic in my area. Any ideas/thoughts on what I could say to my boss? He apparently doesn't care that hospitals are at/near capacity locally and cases are surging and at their highest at any time during the pandemic. I could afford to quit for a while until I find work, so that's also an option, but I've never collected unemployment (not that I want to!) in my 2+ decades of working. Advice? Thoughts? What to say to the boss? I contacted HR and they are working on \"forms\" for people with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe disease, but those won't be ready and I won't have them complete by my doctor by Monday. Should I call in sick the days I'm supposed to be at work? Or take time off? So lost and incredibly stressed out. I was notified the third week of August we would return to office unless covid doesn't improve - and it hasn't - so I wasn't worried but he's serious he wants us back in the office during this surge.",

I got the ticket in May when stuff was looking better pre Delta, going for general admission since it was cheaper. I'm fully vaccinated (<ORG>) and tested once a week, not high risk, and everyone was required to show proof of vaccination or a negative covid test, and wear masks except to drink (and everyone actually followed it around me-there weren't many people drinking and the people that were quickly put their mask back on after), and the state I live in is doing alright at the moment. The band I saw isn't incredibly fast-paced so not everyone was screaming and singing the whole time, and it was a fairly small concert. Because of these factors, I assumed it was safe enough before the concert, but stupidly forgot I had general admission tickets. My friend and I stood near the back but soon people filled in behind us and we were surrounded by a crowd of people. I couldn't stop worrying the whole time but given all of these reasons it wasn't enough to waste my money and make my friend leave (who is also fully vaccinated and didn't seem as concerned by the situation). Given all of this, would you say this was a high risk situation or am I most likely okay (obviously I acknowledge there's no way this was 100% safe)? I've seen so many conflicting sources on the severity of the Delta variant and the duration of vaccine protection (some feeling it's only a bit less safe than it was in May for vaccinated people, others ready to go back to barely seeing people) that I can't tell if this is just slightly over-the-top anxiety after not being in a crowd for a year and a half or if going to this concert was a legitimately dumb/selfish thing to do. I'm going to get tested on Monday anyway but I'm just not sure if I should be avoiding people before that.",

He wears a KN95 while here and I tried to keep my distance, but we chatted for about 10 minutes, and he did give me a hug (while holding his breath).

So looking at where things are right now, I really hope this winter wont be even worse than the last If any of you have any support regarding this, Id love to hear it :)",

With the health issues I have I could easily end up very sick despite being fully vaccinated. I don't think I would die, but I know I would probably struggle a lot. I struggle with my health and ability to work on a daily basis so getting covid could possibly take away my ability to earn an income for a while too so that's a major concern. I'm also a little disappointed that they aren't taking more precautions for the event. Only encouraging masks for those who want to wear them. To be honest, I'd probably go if it were socially distanced and with proof of vaccine or negative test and masks required, but that's not how it's being done. Those things may be annoying but it's just such an easy thing to do. The day is absolutely not about me, but I'm heartbroken that I most likely won't be able to be there for it. He understood when I explained my hesitancy and told me he knows I need to do what I gotta do. I didn't rsvp no because part of me wants to go if I get my booster prior to the event.

(22F) I started a new job a few months ago in a small office (3-5 people) all whom are fully vaxxd. We dont wear masks but regardless I keep my distance as best as I can. Luckily we all have separate offices as well, however, there are times where we have team meetings at a conference table or so and so will come to my office etc to show me something (not always 6ft apart) Ive let go more with being so anal about things, but still keep my guard up. Long story short: my boss JUST came back from a crowded trip and sounds kinda stuffy and my coworker is traveling for a wedding today into next week. This makes my nerves skyrocket. I can avoid them as best as I can but if I feel more uncomfortable I want to politely voice my concerns politely as to not insult them. (I feel they will reject wearing masks and just stay far away) because last time they both traveled I felt like my concerns were laughed off. My birthday is coming up and I dont want to risk anything and my anxiety is making it hard to focus on work. Any suggestions how to bring this up to them? Possible solutions? Thank you so much!",

I then tested my niece who was vaccinated in June, and to my surprise, she was positive (also <ORG>.) Ater this, I decided to get vaccinated, again. However, Walmart denied me another <ORG> shot, so I went to the CVS, I lied, and told them it was my first shot, and got a <ORG> shot instead. I am feeling guilty for this, and I was nervous, but my god were the side effects intense. My fever was higher than my second <ORG> shot, and I had a swollen lymph node underneath my pit, and I was bed-bound for 48 hours. But today I took the test again, and within 2 mins of starting the test, I got a positive reading. Whatever this third shot did, it seems to have supercharged my immune system. However, I would suggest everyone wait for guidance by the FDA. I am in a very weird spot since I took an unapproved third shot. My electronic record card from the state of California does surprisingly have my third <ORG> shot in my record.",

I live in the northeast, and for many states here, the case decline is still nowhere in sight. In NJ, where I live, every day the 7 day average increases from a week before, and out rt is above 1 again after barely falling below 1 a few days ago. Many states already have declining cases, but granted a lot of those were states that were really hit hard by this wave. I know this wave cant last forever, but it just seems like week after week, this wave is getting more and more fuel here. And with winter being so close, I really hope it doesnt set us up for another rough winter, even if its not as bad as the last",

        "Reddit Post": "I've been contact traced this past week after an exposure, but I'm testing negative and feeling OK. I went backpacking with some friends last weekend. Everyone old enough was immunized, but this was a family trip and lots of kids. 4 adults, 7 kids represented three households not normally podded together. It was 95% outside and the kids really benefited from the social experience and exercise. We did all sleep inside a rented cabin. It was a great weekend. The day after we got home, one of the immunized adults had a slight cough and tested positive. No idea where they got it. Symptoms lasted about one day, now they're cooped up at home bored, though they've lost their sense of smell. So everyone else got tested and so far everyone (including the kids) is negative (we do intend to test again in a few more days). They said they've had common colds that felt twenty times worse. I feel our story is a great illustration that vaccines help to reduce not only disease severity but probably also transmission likelihood.",

To begin with everyone in this has been vaccinated for some time vaccinated. My best friend's father in law is quite elderly and due to a fall ended up in a hospital then a rehab clinic. In the rehab clinic he tested positive for Covid. He was sent back to the hospital, were they diagnosed him with pneumonia as well. Long story short, after a week and a half the hospital called and told the family to come say goodbye. They did. They were all required to wear full head to toe protective gear. I happened to be in the area and gave my best friend, and her mother in law a ride home. We all wore masks, and again, we are all vaccinated. I scheduled two tests for 5 days out from the drive. I'm told by some continue to go about your business while wearing a mask. Others say stay at home until you get back your test results. What is the correct answer? Where can I find CDC/WHO guidelines for vaccinated folks around Covid.",

We think that I had it before because I had been sick earlier in the year and was exposed to COVID during months of November. Nothing confirmed though. Where I live we have restrictions to just immediate households members with single individuals being able to meet with one household under 5 people and only that household. My roommates do not follow this at all and constantly have people over. I told them Im not 100% comfortable and we compromised to having one single person a day over because they NEED to see their girlfriends. Last night I came home from work and my roommates both had their girlfriends, not at the same time but still within the same day. My anger got the best of me and I freaked out on them. My roommate said that we need to have a discussion because our definitions of one person over a day arent the same. I admit that I lost my temper but I need someone to tell me that Im not being unreasonable. The look I was given by my one roommate when I told him I wasnt comfortable with people in the house was so invalidating. I havent seen my family and friends in months and theyre bringing people over because we got immunity. I feel like Im going insane here.",

And this is a huge one for me: people are dying of treatable illnesses because of the over-crowding (people that did their part and got vaccinated). Im genuinely asking..what goes on in someones head that thinks like this? Would you not feel guilt if you got sick and ended up in the hospital making the issue worse?

Started coughing yesterday while cleaning and assumed it was my allergies acting up, took some Benadryl and went to bed, woke up with a sore throat &amp; runny nose. No fever, though. I've been sleeping for most of today. I have a COVID test booked for tomorrow morning. I'm hoping this is just worse allergies than usual or the Fall cold I usually get during back-to-school that I avoided last year, but I can't help but feel angry. I live in a small college town. I've been the annoying one skipping events and asking people \"will there be masks there?\" and getting mocked for it. Maybe I haven't been perfectly cautious, but I'm vaccinated and the past year of my life was the worst I've ever felt mentally. In some of my classes, I'm the only one wearing a mask. I have one class in a packed lecture hall with 100+ people and maybe 10 of those people bother to put a mask on. I'm not even sure how much wearing a mask protects me since I'm vaccinated. I'm just so tired. I don't know if anything I'm doing is right or wrong, nobody around me cares if their actions hurt others and some of them even actively joke about \"trying to get covid\" or things along that line. It feels like there's so much guilt around if you get COVID. Like, if you get it then it's your fault for not being a \"better person\" and making \"better choices.\" I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do anymore in terms of protecting myself and I'm lonely and sad and tired of being the killjoy people make fun of and it sucks so much going to a university where I can actually see how little my peers care about others. Any support or words of advice or comfort would be appreciated.",

Also the same day the FDA decided on the booster plan, <ORG> released data showing that the <ORG> vaccine goes from being over 90% effective at preventing hospitalization to 77% after four months of being fully vaccinated. Given this info, should I assume Im only 77% protected from hospitalization? Considering Ive been fully vaccinated since May. Now it would be a little over 4 months since I was fully vaccinated.

He said it's not necessary right now and I would be notified if anything changed. I kind of wish he said I should or that he said \"I'm not going to stop you but it's not necessary right now.\" I guess part of this frustration just comes from the mixed messaging we are getting from the media. God the media is just such scum in America, I know its horrible to say that but they just give terrible messaging.

Things were mildly better back in June - early July when my area was in the green and I could at least go to appointments without fear. Now we're back to very high risk. I wanted to get my hair done for my birthday, because it's been a stressful month and life kind of sucks. But then I spoke to the salon today and they're doing NOTHING to counteract the Delta variant. No air filters, no mask requirements...nothing. Not even an open door. The last time I went, no one wore a mask but me and I had to request my hair stylist wear one. The idea of doing that in the red is just too much right now with my other stressors. And can I just add that it's really, really starting to piss me off how a lot of people people justify not masking anymore because 'If you got <ORG> or <ORG>, getting COVID is basically a bad head cold?' From what I've seen from firsthand accounts, **a breakthrough case is usually NOT just a bad head cold.** This shit can still knock you off your feet, cause breathing issues, and even cognitive impairments. And not to mention, you can still infect other people around you... I don't know about all of you, but I'd rather not even risk a slight chance of lasting damage after the exhaustion of the last year and a half. All my hard work of self-isolation, etc. going to waste would be horrible. How can so many other people NOT get that? **I just knew we were f/cked when mask mandates for indoor spaces were lifted virtually everywhere. Nice to see NY is bringing it back.

I see one study concluding that PCR tests may miss 36% of infection cases in real-world scenarios ([[url] while other studies suggest much smaller fail rates ([[url] Is there any growing consensus on what exactly the rate of false negatives is? For context, I had my second dose of <ORG> mid-April. I stupidly visited my sick, unvaccinated family last weekend, and spent a decent amount of time with them. My father and sister have since both tested positive for COVID-19 (my sister with the PCR test, and I believe my father with the antigen test). I was first exposed to them on Wednesday, Sept 15, and my last exposure was Sunday, Sept 19. I exhibited symptoms on Monday, received a PCR test Tuesday morning (administered by a healthcare professional), and received a negative result today. The reasons I'm doubting it are (1) I spent 5 days with a bunch of unvaccinated, sick people, (2) I myself am now sick. My symptoms are those of a cold/sinusitis (e.g., sneezing, runny nose, headache, fatigue, pressure in ears, etc), but it seems those are also the symptoms of COVID in vaccinated individuals. My sense of taste is subdued (not gone), but I think that's possibly due to congestion rather than COVID. So I'm sort of torn as to whether I should trust my recent test result. Did I get tested too early? Do I get retested? Is it truly just more likely that I have a cold/sinusitis?",

        "Reddit Post": "My partner is a good man. He has covered our rent since we moved in together, makes sure we have food if I cant afford it, and takes good care of me as his girlfriend. My boyfriend has been against the pandemic from the very beginning. He was wearing masks up to a certain point but has even stopped doing that. He has been kicked out of a grocery store for not wearing a mask before in the past year and has state that he will not will a mask in order to get a job, he will not wear a mask in order to enter a building and he wont wear one in order to be there for the birth of my child. He feels like his rights are violated heavily and while I agree with him on how wrong things are, I dont think he should miss the birth of his child for it; its his first child and we are not having anymore kids. I already have a child with a previous partner and do not want to get pregnant a 3rd time. He does not want to get vaccinated which is his right but I believe the Hosptial we are giving birth at requires non vaccinated people to have a mask on at all times. (Vaccinated people do have to wear one as well but I do not have to wear one during childbirth if I come out negative for Covid + proof of vaccine) I told him that if he doesnt want to wear the mask to stay home and not cause anyone stress but he wants to be there. He just doesnt want to not be forced to wear a mask the entire time and will only leave if forced to leave. I dont know what to do because I believe in what hes saying but i dont understand why he cant be selfless about this if its for the birth of his child. Idk if its the right sub for this but what do I do if hes right in saying he has the right to do what he wants but he inevitably wont be able to support me by choosing to stay on his stance of things?",

I tested positive for COVID about a month ago and got pretty sick for a little over a week. My girlfriends grandfather passed away and we traveled out of state to attend his funeral a few days ago. There were a ton of people that came over to her aunts to eat and celebrate his life after the funeral was over and a ton of her family ended up getting sick and tested positive yesterday. I havent gotten sick and dont think I will from the natural immunity from having it so recently and plan on getting the vaccine whenever Im not busy. My question though is, even though I likely wont get sick, will I still produce enough of the virus to pass it on to others? Will I have to quarantine for the next week or two? I need to know since I live with my elderly grandparents and dont want to risk getting them sick, granted they have the vaccine. Thank you in advance.

I'm a little confused about 'people at increased risk for severe illness' and the new category of 'people who are at high risk of professional exposure'. Have they just not defined these categories yet? Do we have any information on what those definitions will be? Will they be left up to the states like in the first role out? Because 'at increased risk' could mean a very small number, or it could mean anyone with any of the preexisting comorbidities from back in last winter (which was defined state by state). Are we looking at a narrow definition - like decreased lung function or previous heart attack - or a broad one, like high blood pressure and obesity? Or is there not enough information to say? The new category of professions - I'm sure that includes healthcare workers, but does it also include teachers? And i'm seeing both 6 months and 8... Again, I'm aware they might not have decided yet, but I've looked and I haven't been able to find anything on what these mean. Figured I'd ask. Thanks.",

I've been reading through articles, and it seems that being vaccinated reduces your changes of long-haul covid by around \\~49%.

        "Reddit Post": "Hello everyone. Ive gotten covid twice. The first time was back in February 20 before everything went down. After that the only long covid symptom that I noticed was lack of concentration. Then, I got covid again on June 21 and have since been experiencing severe anxiety. I had never struggled with anxiety before. I had only had my first attack in January of this year but I can trace the trigger to some relationship issues I was dealing with at the time. However, ever since I got covid this past June Ive been experiencing anxiety on a more constant level. I had a really bad attack at work to the point that a coworker of mine took me to the ER. It comes out of nowhere, I cant place any specific triggers. Im not anxious about getting covid again, so its not that. Yesterday I had a really bad day because for the first time I was anxious all day long. Ever since I ended up in the ER I take a clonazepam pill only when Im having an attack. I thankfully started therapy today because I know I need help. Has anyone experienced post covid/long covid anxiety like this? Meaning not necessarily because one is afraid of covid. It just simply happens. If so, what has helped you? How long has it been happening? Has it gone away for you? Thank you.",

We have been homeschooling because we did not think it was safe to send them back unvaccinated. &amp;#x200B; We have a babysitter who has had the J &amp; J vaccine, and she goes out with a boyfriend who she claimed was vaccinated, and visits him every night. Well it turns out that her boyfriend has only had one of the two shots (I think it was <ORG>), and she was also hanging out (unmasked) with the brother of the boyfriend who is completely unvaccinated and who tested positive for Covid on Tuesday (3 days ago). She had hung out with them for hours on both Sunday and Monday. Yesterday (Thursday) she went to get tested (nasal PCR test). Today, Friday, she received a negative test result from yesterday's test. &amp;#x200B; My thoughts are that I'm not sure about the accuracy of the test or if the incubation period has been long enough to develop a positive test result, or even if there is a likelihood of a breakthrough infection from being exposed to the unvaccinated Covid positive brother. The babysitter is eager to get back to work. Aside from the fact that I am pretty unhappy about her lack of masking, when would it theoretically be safe to let her come back and be with our unvaccinated kids? &amp;#x200B; Thank you for your input. If this is not allowed, please let me know and I'll take it down. I really did do at least 2 hours of research and am still not 100% sure what the correct answer is.",

It started with fever, chills, and headaches nearly 12 days ago. My fevers are essentially gone, my GI symptoms are tapering off, but I'm just worn down with the pain when I try to take deep breaths or do my breathing exercises. I'm tired of the night sweats. And the rash is annoying. I can't wait to feel better, but knowing that this could be a long haul, or that I may not be out of the woods yet, frankly leaves me feeling anxious. Looking back I'm a dumbass for not getting the vaccine. I was waiting to see which of the brands was the better option, because every negative report would make me anxious. Plus I'm married to an anti vaxxer. I just never got around to it. So far the rest of my family is fine, which I am thankful for. This is hard though.

What gave me the most fear was this quote straight from my universitys health chancellor: &gt; My expectation is that for the rest of the fall and winter its essentially going to get worse, If he has a major hand in the Covid policies at my school, and hes predicting this, Im seriously afraid his statement here could influence my university to go remote or impose more restrictions on in-person activities. And if January would be the worst of this wave, Im afraid this would make spring 2022 significantly remote as well if this surge makes many professors uncomfortable with returning to in-person teaching. This also took a hit on the hopes I had from the [recent news]([url] that the current surge may be the last major surge.

She's the first one to bring the virus in our house from her school, my parents tested positive last Friday, I've been trying to isolate in my room while wearing a mask when outside my room and avoiding as much contact as possible. Long story short, this morning I woke up with a scratchy throat with some mucus buildup, did a rapid antigen test, showed positive within 10 minutes. I'm both anxious and disappointed at the same time. I know that we have the best protection we can currently get against this virus and that in theory we should be ok however I'm just afraid of brushing off this virus as a minor thing because loads of people have called this virus \"a bad cold\" or \"just the flu\" only to end up in hospitals or way worse you know? I'm disappointed because I build up this image in my head of the vaccine as a COVID shield that makes you really resistant to COVID and that it's super hard to get infected with it. I was even reading a case of a doctor who had the <ORG> vaccine who spent hours next to COVID patients and the doctor never got COVID. Now that I have it I feel extremely let down especially because I did try to take all the precautionary measure I possibly could. In the end I feel like having the vaccine made no difference to our family being infected because we got it anyways. Breakthrough cases are supposed to be 1 in 500, what are the odds of 3 of them in one household? Anyhow, my symptoms are just now starting, I have a very mild fever and my head feels kinda fuzzy but I expect them to get way worse in the coming days so I hope I don't have to be hospitalized that would be quite terrifying. I wanted to get this disappointment off my chest because I felt like sharing this with someone, thank you for reading and with some luck hopefully we will recover from this.",

Everyone at the concert has to be vaccinated but it will definitely be the kind of show where everyone is tightly packed together and there will be a most pit and crowd surfing. When I got the tickets Delta wasn't really a concern yet and I felt like outdoor with everyone vaccinated would make it 100 percent safe. Now I can't tell if this is totally safe or a super reckless decision. I'm considering going but standing outside of the crowd. I'm going with a friend who will definitely be in the mosh pit area and the idea of leaving them and standing on the sidelines really doesn't sound fun, but I'm kind of terrified of Delta at this point so am considering it. What do people think the risk of an outdoor concert where everyone is vaccinated, but will be tightly packed together is?",

For instance, I came home from work on the 7th and started sneezing and had bad congestion. The first thing that popped into my mind, Covid. So I do an at-home test, on the 13th negative, I kept sneezing so I do the second at-home test Wednesday negative. Still sneezing, went to the clinic that same day and got tested, negative. Still sneezing but now with a sore throat, I wait a few days and get tested that Friday, negative. It went away for a few days and came back and I ended up having a sneezing fit with a slight cough at night. Last Thursday I got a drive-thru PCR test because I haven't stopped sneezing. Got the results back, Sunday negative. Today, still sneezing with a runny nose. I had Covid in October of last year and my first symptom was sneezing. So ever since I've been soooo paranoid about getting it again. Especially since I live with immunocompromised people. I had a blood drawn allergy test earlier this month and it was negative for everything. I'm tired of every time this happens I start trying to play \"connect the dots\" to wonder if I've been exposed. I know those that are vaxxed will get \"mild\" symptoms and are less likely to be hospitalized or die or the long haul is cut by 50%. But I'm not seeing is any mention of is whether those who are vaxxed have any damage such as myocarditis or anything else that happens with those unvaxxed or if it exacerbates problems for those who got Covid a previous time.",

I went this morning for a PCR test (results already came back negative), the person administering my test had the mask not fully around her nose, her nostrils were covered but it was getting close to being underneath her nose. what are the odds i would catch covid from her given the fact she was possibly exposed to positive patients? it is a bit irresponsible and i was shocked she did not have more gear on other than a regular surgical mask. my mask was only down for about a minute for her to swab me.",

Unfortunately, due to the bungled vaccine rollout in our country as well as the Delta variant that reputation has been destroyed in 2021. We are currently at our absolute worst point since the pandemic started. Today we got 1435 cases, which I know if you're from America or Europe you might roll your eyes at us and think this number is tiny, but to us this is huge and unbelievably demoralising. We're poised to get out of lockdown around October 28th which is when we're predicted to hit 70% double dosed and we'll have more freedoms once we're 80% double dosed. But there is a huge fear of the hospitals being overrun here when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths skyrocketing and having to go back into lockdown even at high vaccination rates. I am feeling so defeated right now, although I am fully vaxxed so its some comfort to be protected. I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire. Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? Thanks.",

To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications. Also, if anybody here had the same symptoms (burning stomach, burning chest or the headache without fever), please feel free to share any tips that helped you or helped someone else you know. Thank you!",

Like I was freaking out over omicron, but then saw it was mild then felt better. But now people say omicron is still dangerous even if it is mild. Also read one source saying the <ORG> vaccine is effective against omicron while another said it's useless, which scares me since I have both <ORG> vaccines and am due for a booster next month. It doesn't help that I work at a movie theater and we have tons of sold out shows for Spiderman. I seriously feel that I should quit having hope because it seems like there's always something that's going to take us back to square one and that I'm not allowed to feel any kind of relief or happiness since so many people are suffering from losing loved ones and dealing with long covid. I had covid back in spring and I was lucky that it was mild, I know many others are not so lucky. It especially sucks since I've been having good things happening to me for the first time in years, like changing my career path by going back to school and enjoying it. But I feel like I'm selfish for being happy when we're still in a deadly pandemic. I'm also afraid I might have to cancel my plans to go to a convention in May I've missed out on the last two years if things continue to spiral downwards. tl;dr I just feel so tired of trying to have hope that the pandemic is starting to improve, or feeling guilty about finding some sort of joy in my life after years of depression when many others don't have that.",

Though I didnt hesitate to get the vaccine, you could say I was technically vaccine-hesitant in my mind because I was already making that call based on that information and thinking about it. Now, it seems like Omicron is less deadly. And meanwhile, the thing that complicates things for me on a personal level is that my tinnitus feels like it has gotten worse. Not correlated due to the vaccine, but somehow on its own weeks after I took the vaccine. I legit dont think the vaccine is the reason for it, but Im in a position where this thing is pretty loud, and inducing an immune response could backfire and make it unbearable. Im legitimately fearful of that at this point. Just how certain is it that the booster wont make me feel more sick as the second shot, to the point of affecting tinnitus? Right now what Im thinking is that I wait 1 or 2 more weeks, since Im off of work and school for the break, and I can observe if a regular sleep pattern and lack of stress will make me habituate again. If that happens, I wont hesitate to take it bu Christmas. Thats the plan right now at least.",

I thought that the restrictions announced yesterday (50% capacity limit with 1000+ people in a venue) wouldn't dent my plans to meetup with family and friends over the holidays, but after hearing the news of more \"circuit-breaker\" measures being considered it just made me think that this is pretty much what we'll have to do in the foreseeable winters, even if we have all the protection in the world from vaccines. Nothing I've done has mattered, I feel like by the time we're truly beyond this, my youth (the years I should have spent meeting people and maybe finding love) will be done and dusted. Sure, I'll get my vaccine and boosters and whatnot, but the powers that be will continue to find ways to ruin everything for me, just as they're doing right now, including forcing online university, online work, and just making my efforts to improve my life utterly in vain. Remember when we thought that the worst of this pandemic would be over in September 2021? I thought so too, but I guess we were wrong.",

        "Reddit Post": "So the past few months I've been doing well and avoided Reddit and other Covid news, and my mental health improved during that time, but since news broke about Omicron, my Reddit/doomscrolling obsession came back full force. I feel like my mental health is going down the drain, but I just couldn't stop sometimes. The reason I couldn't stop sometimes is because I have this irrational fear that if I stopped, I'd just be putting my head in the sand and falling into a delusional slumber, and I won't be \"awake\" to the threat on the horizon. The past few days have been rough. There's been so many times I was reading a news article or a Reddit thread and felt tears welling up in my eyes, but could not stop as my irrational mind feared I'd then fall into a delusional slumber. I am literally destroying my mental health for the sake of staying \"awake\". I need to stop. But I'm starting to notice that whenever I'm browsing Reddit, the most reassuring things I see are updates from well-established Twitter experts that do a good job of describing the situation in a balanced manner (e.g. <PERSON> with the vaccination updates and Chise with the Omicron updates). Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health. So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from? Ones that are balanced in their presentation of the facts - not doom and gloom, but not blindly optimistic either. I'll just go to them for my daily Covid updates from now on, and this way I'll stay \"awake\" without all the needless anxiety.",

My wife felt completely fine until Thursday, and has now been confirmed positive as well (almost 5 days after my result). This had led to a few questions, and Im curious to learn best practices around isolation here. 1. Given we live together, should I be isolating for the full duration of my wifes 10 days as well, which would effectively be 15 days for me? 2. Is it safe to run errands fully masked after my 10 day isolation is over even though she is still isolating? 3. Is it safe for our dogs to be near us, or do we need to find alternative care for them temporarily? The staggered nature of our symptoms/test results is whats causing the uncertainty around what best practices should be here and we want to make sure were being safe.

One of them coughed about 6 feet away from me (before I knew he was exposed), and we were outside. All of us were masked, except the one who coughed kept lowering his mask under his nose Should I be concerned? I was getting tested because Im going abroad in two days. Now Im worried Ill end up positive as soon as I arrive because of this interaction. Please tell me if Im being over dramatic and have no reason to be concerned",

Because I've heard scientist say it's foolish to think Omicron is mild, it might be worse. If the Omicron is worse, then those South Africa Scientists lied to us. Just for that, there is no hope for the end of the pandemic next year. It's Delta and Omicron's fault. And I bet there will be more variants for many years to come. Then I guess I have no choice, but I'm giving up hope if the Omicron is worse as Delta and there will be no end of the pandemic for the whole decade. I'm sorry, guys, but maybe 2022 is not going to be a good year. I hope I work on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, because I feel like not celebrating a new year that will be as bad as 2020 and 2021.",

Ive heard everything from the variant being less severe and milder but being far more contagious, to it being much more contagious in just as bad as Delta. For the record I am fully vaccinated and I got my booster shot last Friday. My father just got his second shot on Monday. But Im not sure who to believe about this.

Personal risk assessment request here: My parents and brother were going to take a direct flight from Pittsburgh to Austin next week to visit me and my husband for the holidays. Theyve all been boosted with moderna since October. They all have comorbidities (overweight, parents with controlled hypertension, brother has asthma). Im getting my booster this Saturday. I was exposed to Covid by my husband during the delta surge. He had a breakthrough case then. Me and hubs were vaccinated. We feel hes safe for another month before he needs a booster. Regardless, it looks everyone and their grandmas is getting Covid tonight in NYC/DC.. so were just kind of dumbfounded. I have a generalized anxiety disorder so Im pretty sure the worst (and slightly probable) outcome is that my family comes down with some sickness before they fly out. We were planning on just cooking at home and not really seeing any other groups. I plan on staying away from stores and the gym, just go into the office wear everybody is masked and vaccinated at least twice. This honestly all feels so goddamn insane to me this is the SECOND holiday season where Covid is in the background lurking as a threat like why? What the fuck was this all for? Can all just get this fucking virus and go home? Ugh.",

How long is the fevers usually lasting in children with this. I get them to break but they just keep coming back. I figured surely that it would be about over for them by now. My wife is still feeling a little crummy but is mostly OK since she's vaxxed. This has been a long long week so far. Hopefully if I end up with it it'll be after they all get better so they can take care of me lol.",

They knew winter means more infection, which makes it different to Delta peaking in warmer months. They knew and chose to do nothing, till last minute we get a huge rush of restrictions do now everything except shops, bars/restaurants (but only serving alcohol till 10pm wow!!!) and essential services can be open. This is \"untill we can control the infection and know enough about omicron\", so basically indefinite. The government excuses today at the press meeting included \"well it wasn't so bad wjth Delta so we didn't expect this with Omicron!!!\" (Omicron is in mid winter) And \"upping intensive capacity is accepting that more people will die\" (ok but what for example about the many covid patients who aren't in intensive care but still need to be isolated from non-positve patients?). I am so angry and it is hard to cope with, how can I not believe this will continue every winter for years when this is how it is being handled? Sure omicron itself couldn't specifically be predicted, but they knew new variants would come, and they knew winter numbers would rise, and they did nothing till it got to almost lockdown level of bad. If this was th last winter we'd spend like this I would handle it much better, as most of my fear is coming from this being a yearly thing indefinitely, but it feels more and more like it will keep happening. The government refusing to support the healthcare enough till it gets to this state, vaccines are not enough on their own. This feels hopeless.",

Everyone reassured us our high vaccination rate would help, but just as I expected, our high population density seems to be kicking our ass just like it did in April 2020. We may have a high vaccination rate working in our favor, but we also have a high population density working against our favor.

My dad is the only person I know who is not vaccinated, but not just that- he refuses to get covid tested as well. I haven't spent longer than one day at home since August, before I started grad school, because of this issue. He's been sick this past week, but I don't know with what. He's never officially had covid before, neither have I or my mom. He actually lied and said he got tested when he really didn't. He claims covid testing \"puts something in your body.\" He even refuses at-home testing. I have tried literally everything to convince him to get vaccinated and tested. Literally every argument I could think of. I simply have no more patience at this point to continue arguing with him. And even though he hasn't gotten sick throughout this whole pandemic, with how transmissible the new variant is, it seems to be pretty inevitable. He works retail, and to add to it all, he's also anti-mask. I didn't go home for Thanksgiving for this reason, and of course my parents were both pissed. Now that Christmas is coming, they're even more angry as you can imagine. Realistically I know I wouldn't be severely ill if I got covid (vaccinated, 21 and healthy) but I'm absolutely terrified of getting a mild case and having it develop into long-haul covid. That's my biggest fear. I'm not sure what to do here. I spent Thanksgiving with a few vaccinated friends, but everyone's with their families for Christmas, and I don't want to be alone. Another option is for my mom to come over to my apartment, without my dad, but at the same time I feel guilty for leaving him alone on Christmas. Am I exaggerating with this? I don't want to spend Christmas alone but at the same time I really don't want to potentially have long-haul symptoms for months or even years because of this decision.",

But I took a chance and went to see a band months ago in a small venue once I'd been fully vaccinated. Literally counted less than 60 people in a hall that normally houses 600-700. Double masked, sanitized, the whole bit. Then this week... I researched this place, same size as the other venue. Concert wasn't sold out, looked like plenty of room, good ventilation and the band insisted on masks. The venue ignored the mask rule. Absolutely packed the place. The second band (which was horrible btw) kept encouraging crowd surfing and moshing and it went nuts. But by this time...I've invested 5 hours into this. I think it will be over in a few songs and I don't know that any of these people even want to be around for the actual headliner. But it went on and on. And then the headliner comes on. They are clearly annoyed with the venue but they too encourage \"the energy\" (paraphrasing) and do nothing to stop this. It is stifling, even when I move back from it all. So I'm freaking out at this point (right now) thinking I wasted all that effort all that time quarantining and I could end up sick over this stupid decision and one truly sh!##y band. I did just lose my best friend earlier this year to Covid. I should have known better. Logically, I'm boosted. I was double masked. I sanitized everything I touched. The odds of anything bad happening are statistically so radically small, but my brain won't hear it, so I've been having trouble sleeping...",

But whenever a new variant comes out, I wonder if we need to reconsider whether or not the virus might be spreading through other avenues as well. I know that in the early days of the pandemic, doctors and scientists thought that the virus spread through fomites and were unsure about whether or not it spread through food. That suggests to me that in principle, coronavirus is can sometimes spread that way, even if the original COVID-19 coronavirus did not. So, when the virus mutates, is it reasonable to suppose that it might have found ways to transmit through fomites or food? Or, more happily, is there some reason to think that the particular nature of the COVID-19 coronavirus means that this won't happen even after a significant mutation? Thank you!",

We are then planning on spending the days afterward with my family, including my sister and her fiance who will first fly to a big family reunion and then fly to see us.

My girlfriend couldnt even see me for the entire year. My mother would go to her job and the store come home and I would stay home and do online classes. Of course this messed with my mental health but I was used to it. I dont have a job due to him, I cant go back to normal classes bc of him. My mother and him would get into shouting matches every week bc he would force her to wash her hands after touching her face or when she bringing in stuff and the item would accidentally touch her clothes. In April of this year and I finally was able to go out bc I got vaccinated everything felt like it was going back to normal of course since omicron and delta is around he is going back to being controlling ways. I cant even go in my backyard without a mask. I have to lie to him just to go wherever I want to. He doesnt even want me to go to her house and were all vaccinated. He yelled at me just because I went in the backyard with my slippers and walked back in with it on. I bought clothes from someone off of an app and he tells me how Im putting the family at risk for doing that. He tells me how I must want to kill myself with the virus because I shouldnt order clothes from anyone even thought the clothes is new and I wash it after buying it. Its getting to the point where Im starting to dislike him. This isnt the same man who raised me. Im 23 Im not 16 or 15 Im a grown ass man and he still wants me to act like the child I was.

(Frequent fainting at work made me increasingly unreliable) The only problem is that Im working at a Gamestop in the middle of the second worst county in the country in terms of new Covid cases. Im double vaxxed and got my booster last week, but Im not a healthy woman. (76lbs underweight and anemic) When I get sick, I get *siiiick*. I was also recently taken off my parents health insurance, so if I get a particularly bad case of Rona, Ill just have to die because Ill never be able to afford hospitalization. Luckily, Gamestop has taken *some* precautions. My store has a Masks STRONGLY recommended sign on the door, but only the employees actually wear masks. Theres also a hand sanitizer dispenser by the door. Theres no bag in it, so its useless, but the thought is there. Im a few days into this job, and Ive probably been within three feet of three-hundred people without masks on. Maskless kids are common, coughing without covering their mouths then touching the displays. I have to take used games and consoles from strangers who might have kept them in a house with five sick individuals for all I know. Its terrifying. I cant NOT work. I have $34.01 in my bank account, and I still havent gotten Christmas gifts for my family (which they are VERY vocal about expecting, but thats a vent post for another subreddit). I know I have to work, but its getting really, really hard to convince myself to show up and actually *risk my life* for $9/hr. Im scheduled for forty more hours this week, which Im thankful for because hooray money, but horrified at the potential consequences. I just want someone to tell me my fears are valid and that Im not a weenie for being worried about my situation. My situation being risking what is *probably* my certain death in pursuit of earning less than nine dollars an hour. Every second Im there Im teetering on the edge of a panic attack. Its awful and I just want to quit, but I cant and I feel trapped.",

My father and I are both fully vaccinated but the rest of our family is not. I am wondering what to do if my father or I gets COVID while we are out of state. I would ideally like to drive back home (a 5 hour trip) in the event either of us get sick but am not sure if it would be better/safer to instead bring my father for treatment immediately (while out of state) instead of driving five hours back home to bring him to his own local hospital. I know it is imperative to receive immediate treatment when a person is high risk so am concerned about making the long trip home. If I get COVID and my father does not, my sibling doesn't have enough space to self isolate so I could not stay at the house and would have to drive home. The problem is with this scenario is that my father would need to come with me (I am his caretaker) but I would be worried sick that he would get COVID from me on the long five hour drive back home. I also wouldn't be able to leave my father at my siblings house with six unvaccinated family members while I self-isolate due to his being high risk. I have discussed the dangers and have pleaded with my father not to go, but we haven't been to my siblings since COVID started and he hasn't seen his grandchildren and yearns to spend time with them over the holiday, so is determined to go despite the risks. I am worried sick about this and would appreciate any advice or guidance others may have regarding this terrible predicament.",

Last year, nothing was on the up, everything was negative, over 4k deaths per day, everything shut down, outdoor mask mandates everywhere, barely any people vaccinated, and so on. Now, this winter is better because we do not have most of last years craziness. Omicron is shit but remember, the vaccines still work well against it, and more people are getting vaccinated daily. By February or March, the situation will hopefully get better, and we will see the same discussions that we had last Feb/March/April/May. It will get better very soon, I can guarantee that. For those who are asking, at one point, governments will notice that restrictions and mask mandates are counterproductive for the vaccination effort, and that in future pandemics, governments will find a lot of anti-vaxxers who have rejected the vaccine because of the restrictions that the government is levying on the vaccinated, so to avoid this scenario, governments will lift these restrictions sooner than later.",

I regret not getting a second test but now too much time has passed that I'm sure I'm negative even if I had it. I have been vaccinated but not boosted. Can an antibody test give me any insight whatsoever as to whether I may have just had covid? Can they differentiate between the vax and natural immunity at all?

She has been even more careful than me (and I've been crazy careful). While she's home now, she's still suffering, and she has remarked that the idea that Omicron is \"milder\" may anecdotally not always be universally accurate. She does have some pre-existing conditions but before this was not someone I would consider incapable of living her life or who was obviously disabled in any way. I am starting to rethink my own holiday plans in light of this development, and I'm beginning to become worried about whether my university will be back in person next semester (part of me is hoping we're not, but then that means it'll be because things are worse). What I sincerely want for everyone reading is to have a safe, happy, careful holiday season that results in no illness, no undue stress, and no surprise visits to the ER. I want us to all live through this scary time and know that in the new year there will be additional treatment options and things that may further mitigate this, but right now it is indeed rocky and shaky. It doesn't mean we're without hope, however, and I strongly encourage everyone to think of ways you can support your own and your loved ones' mental health this season.",

My family and I are all vaccinated (Some boosted, as myself I have to wait for my 6 months since I got my 2nd shot in September) and I was told I shouldn't worry, that it's all in my head. To which I was like \"no mask, people unmasking to eat (I'm still 100% on masks got my good old KN95 real ones, as my family does wear them unless the town mandates it), with a sold out show. Because that's safe\". Get told I'm wasting my life by not doing anything, blah blah blah I'm sure a lot of you have heard this same song and dance. What I hate is, I'm a natural introvert. I like my peace, quiet and solitude and always have. But the constant fight back and me wanting to feel safe puts a strain on me that no one understands. I had Covid in March, and my Mother had it in May and was in the hospital. She is fine, but still like, it puts a mental strain on ya a bit. Also she wasn't going. Still, I just feel that my family needs to think a little bit before doing gatherings. Hell, I suggested to see it on a Monday afternoon after work. Honestly, the best time can enjoy the movie. Oh no, gotta see it during the hype crowd cheering which I get. Anywho, I feel better I made this post. Thanks for listening.",

I was hoping that it would only be yearly but clearly that's not the case because the virus mutates way too fast for the vaccines to stop transmission. And then also on a abc news interview fauci said masks on airplanes will never go away which is really scary to me. Because if what he's saying is correct it means mask mandates will never truly go away which will ruin my life forever. Masks make communication so much harder, people misgender me and I don't like how I look with a mask. When I was in Orlando last month it felt so liberating to not have to wear a mask and be fully glammed up with makeup. [url]",

When I got back to the EU, however, I found out that getting my second jab would *not* entitle me to get my EU corona certificate, which would mean quarantine and/or testing before/after travel to any other EU country. My home country refused to allow my proof of vaccination in my home country as legit; very frustrating. Because I need to travel for work, I just opted for the path of least resistance - because I officially hadn't gotten my second jab in my residence (EU) country, I just had a third jab there (this time, <ORG>). The timing was approximately: 1st jab, late June (EU/<ORG>); 2nd jab, early July (non-EU/<ORG>); third jab, early September (EU/<ORG>). I'm in a queue now for my booster shot, but I may have to travel back to my home country because of yet another family problem - and with Omicron, and three long flights, I'm worried. So I'm wondering - did my third jab, back in September, afford me any additional protection? Or was it just overkill - of, if it had given me any additional protection, perhaps it's all worn off by now? Thanks for any solid input.",

However, I woke up this morning to my father in the basement with me. He developed a sore throat yesterday and he let me know he just tested positive this morning (12/20). He is 51, fully vaxxed, had a heart attack 10+ years ago in which he had triple bypass and open heart surgery. He is on medication for life including blood thinners and he has sleep apnea I believe. However he has really made a change in his diet and lifestyle since his heart attack. He exercises almost every day and some could call him a health nut now lol. He signed up today to receive antibodies so hopefully in the next day or so he will qualify and can receive it. My father is my best friend and I feel an immense amount of guilt on my shoulders because I probably was the one who got him sick. If anything happens to him I wont be able to live with myself. If anyone could provide me with some reassuring words I would really love that.. My friends have dropped off the face of the earth and havent even checked to see how Im doing so I feel very alone right now. I appreciate any words and hope everyone is staying safe.",

        "Reddit Post": "Pain in lymph node, delayed symptom onset. Should I[26F] keep getting Covid vaccinations? Im 26F, 123 lbs, 5.2, no known health conditions, on birth control, that just got her booster shot. I originally had the moderna shots but then switched to <ORG> for the booster. My first shot of moderna gave me no symptoms. Second shot was intense but I recovered within less then 48 hours with no lingering symptoms. This time around, I have developed some pain near my rib cage which Im assuming is near one of my axiallary lymph nodes. I know this has been a reported but not frequent side effect (maybe 10-11% report this?). Im very concerned that this immune response is damaging long term. Again, this pain wasnt noticeable until over 48 hours from injection and it comes and goes. I got the booster over 2 days ago. As a layperson, I would feel more COMFORTABLE getting vaccines that dont cause such immunogenicity in me. I typically never react to the flu shots, I got my flu shot this past month as well. I am not convinced that everyone needs to continue to take these shots, and everyone that does have more long lasting or severe side effects should avoid these shots. Is there any basis to my fears or are these shots actually safe?",

I kept delaying my second dose because of my new hectic schedule and because i was afraid of it knocking me out and possibly causing me to miss work. I had it finally scheduled for November when my husband contracted covid from a co-worker and brought it home. So before i got my second dose, everyone in my home (me, and kids as well) caught covid. We quarantined, ordered food so we didn't have to go out etc. Did everything by the book. We recovered (luckily it was very mild for us) and are back to work and school. Here are my questions. Everyone around is getting booster shots and now even children are getting shots. I've been asking around as to whether we should get boosters or not and i keep getting mixed answers. Some people are telling me since i got covid, it's not necessary for me to get any vaccine for a while, we got the antibodies in us so we're good. Including the kids. Other people are telling me to get the second dose and to vaccinate my kids..I asked our doctor and he is just as mixed as everyone else...He basically said \"its up to you\" Ugh..Could anyone here please tell me what we should be doing and why?

A few days ago, we found out our college age nephew has COVID. He is quarantining in the upstairs of their home. His younger, 10 year old brother is not vaccinated. On top of that, my wife's older brother has cancer and is receiving all sorts of immunotherapy to keep the brain, bone and liver cancer at bay. We were supposed to be visiting with him on this trip too. One of my biggest worries through all of the pandemic was the fear of me infecting someone else. Indefinitely don't want to infect her brother. We found out that our family members at our destination are still eating out in restaurants, (with unvaccinated family members), going to exercise classes, and playing group sports. And when my wife talked to them last night, it sounds like they shamed her for considering not making the trip and coaxing her by saying, \"Are you going to hide in your house forever?\", and \"You know there's just going to be another variant after this one, right? It's not going to end, so start living your life\". Disclaimer: we have been living our lives and getting back some normality (eating in restaurants, going to some group events) but we choose to do things when there are not huge crowds and masked. Now my wife wants to go just to prove them wrong to show them she's not scared. Well, I'll admit, I'm a little frightened. It's not that I think I'm going to die from COVID at this point, but I still do have concerns for spreading the virus AND I generally don't like getting sick, especially if I'm far from home and have to drive 10 hours back home. Thanks for listening. I needed to get that off my chest.",

Yesterday afternoon and into today I started experiencing mild cold symptoms (tickle in throat, very slight cough and very slight stuffy nose). Naturally, I'm panicking because, while it is cold season, I'm fearing that I have COVID, and the timing could not be worse. Not only am I supposed to see my family during the holiday, I also went to a couple holiday parties over the weekend. &amp;#x200B; I had COVID in January and I am fully vaccinated, but have not yet received my booster. I am 28 years old. I am planning on getting tested today. While worrying that I will miss the opportunity to see my family over Christmas is hard enough, if I test positive I would need to tell everyone I saw at work yesterday and over the weekend that I tested positive, and they would then need to get tested and potentially ruin their holidays. I would feel like such an awful person and that all of my friends and colleagues would see me as the one who ruined their Christmas. I really hope it's just a cold, but last time I thought I had a cold I got tested and wound up with COVID. I know this might sound selfish but I almost considered not getting tested just so I wouldn't know if I had it or not, but I know the moral thing to do is find out. Everyone I was at the parties with is vaccinated so hopefully they are okay if I test positive. &amp;#x200B; Am I doing the right thing? What if I had it a month ago and didn't notice, and I test positive because of the antibody and it's just a cold masquerading as COVID symptoms? How do I deal with the burden of potentially ruining the holidays of all my friends, putting others at risk? This is really weighing me down mentally and I could use support. I'm getting teary-eyed at the thought of spending Christmas alone. It's the one time of year I look forward to the most :(",

I just tested positive for COVID the second time this week. I have a slight runny nose But I feel great, I Just ran a mile and a half in 9:22. (Ive been training for a PT test) I am confused. I am extremely healthy, no fast food, mostly water and gatorade while working out. Vitamins everyday, no smoking and very rarely drinking. What am I doing wrong? First it was you can't get COVID twice, then the vaccine should protect you, then the booster should help even more. I do everything right, I take my health very seriously. Do I have a bad immune system? What else can I do. Id love to hear other peoples input on this.",

I told my boss my concerns with going and he said he still wants to send someone so if I feel uncomfortable he can send X (X is a more junior employee), so I feel like if I dont go it will be detrimental to my career because this very ambitious person just below me on the corporate ladder would get to go to the conference I had been wanting to go to. I am triple vaxxd and quasi-immunocompromised. I also have an important friend function to attend the following weekend and if I got COVID, even mild, I would of course need to stay home. Thoughts?",

As the title states, I would greatly appreciate some insight on how long it took you (or someone you know) who is FULLY VACCINATED (two doses) to test negative after being infected. For example, how many days/weeks/months from the day you found out you had COVID to the day you finally tested negative did it take? I am finally on my last day of isolation, but I still would like to test negative before seeing my family and friends. Isolation has been the worst part of it all for me. Seriously, it is like being in prison. Luckily I'm able to return to work tomorrow, but I am still going to refrain from seeing my friends and family until I test negative. It sucks, but spreading COVID is even worse! Thank you all in advance!",

We think she was exposed last Monday, I stayed over at his house on Wednesday after and saw him but didnt go into the house on Saturday. He doesnt like his roommates too much so he has minimal interactions with them. We are only double vaxxed (have a booster booked for mid January). She is pretty much asymptomatic, but decided to take a test to be safe for Christmas. My bf and I have no symptoms yet and my rapid test came out negative but those are pretty unreliable. He has his PCR booked for the 23rd, I have mine tomorrow. My anxiety is through the roof, I saw 2 of my friends after my bf so I hate that they might be exposed too. Is there any chance we didnt get it? The other roommate btw who probably had a lot more direct interactions with her had a negative rapid test which is kind of promising but Im not getting my hopes up. I have a cottage weekend booked in 2 weeks and thats literally the only thing that kept me going so now thats probably is gone too. And my province is probably going into lockdown soon. I lost all hope. Im so scared to develop symptoms and to have long COVID. I feel like I have symptoms but Im probably just freaking out at this point.",

I hate how people act as though one is selfish for missing a crucial part of their life that they will never get back.

At first I believed that it was because of the pollution, the aqi levels in my city were up high at 350 and I normally do get a scratchy throat and sinus issues because of it. I'm 19 and fully vaccinated and everyone that I live with (except for my 15 year old sister) is fully vaccinated too. But today, my sore throat has gotten worse (its uncomfortable to gulp) and I'm sneezing a lot, which apparently isn't listed as a covid symptom but I'm getting really paranoid and I think I've caught covid. I've resorted to natural home remedies like honey ginger tea and drinking warm water for some relief but sneezing with a sore throat is the most painful feeling ever. My father (who is taking this very lightly because he thinks he knows everything) says that it's seasonal because I don't have cough or fever but I really don't want to take a chance and infect my sister. Should I get tested right away or wait for sometime? (though my anxiety wants me to go for it right away)",

I don't know what to believe anymore, and I'm terrified of losing my mom to this virus.",

Tickets are bought, suitcase is (almost) packed. But now I'm freaking out. People in my home country are not very keen on the COVID measures, to say the least. Very few people wear masks, a lot of the population still isn't vaccinated, QR-codes mostly aren't getting checked, so it could be quite dangerous. Especially for me, because if the worst scenario happens and I'll get COVID - I'm fucked royally, since I don't have an insurance of my home country and they won't even let me in the plane. But the alternative doesn't seem much better, because if I won't fly, I'll be all alone during my holidays (I don't have any friends besides her), and I can await a sad, pathetic and lonely NYE. Not to mention that a good chunk of money will be lost (plane tickets are non-refundable sadly) and don't even get me started about how pissed off my friend would be because of the last moment flaking. So, what would be the more reasonable choice? Thank you in advance.",

What am I supposed to do in the face of that information? I have plans tomorrow to fly home and see my family who are vaccinated and boosted and take precautions as well (my brother recently got back from a cruise but tested negative with a rapid test and is waiting on a PCR result before driving to see us, but he may come down even if he tests positive and just wear a mask in the house). I feel like I am in a rabbit hole now of Twitter threads and news articles where people describe how horrible their symptoms are and that avoiding COVID at all costs should be your number one goal in life. to paraphrase one Twitter user. Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this stress? I feel like I should avoid traveling in case my brother has COVID even though that would mean spending Christmas alone. Thank you all for your time!",

I'm fully vaccinated, and getting my booster tomorrow, so I'm not too worried about myself. I'm keeping up with masking and distancing and all that while living my life However, I'm more worried about my dad. He also (begrudgingly) got fully vaccinated, but now he's telling me he absolutely refuses to get a booster now or ever. It's better than him being unvaccinated, but still He doesn't trust that \"enough research\" has been done. He thinks the way they call it a vaccine when it \"isn't a vaccine at all, it's a shot\" (????) is suspicious. I told him it's just semantics at this point but he insists that it means something is up I've told him \"look at everyone around us who got vaxxed and boosted, they're fine\", but it feels like there's no getting through to him. I could just take the \"okay well deal with the consequences\" route but that's easier said than done with a family member. If happen to get it, I know I'll be fine, but him? I don't know. It doesn't help that I'm going to a convention out of state in a couple weeks",

I had a lung collapse, and a lung surgery when I was 17, and dealt with some pain for a few years after, mostly in extreme weather conditions. 5 years later, that hasn't been an issue and I honestly don't feel like I've ever had surgery, but now I have COVID and I don't know what to do. I was exposed on Thursday unknowingly, started showing symptoms on Saturday, that I found out on Monday may have been due to exposure, so I got tested. My symptoms (knock on wood) as of now are mild. They feel like common cold symptoms except for the migraine that persisted from Sunday-Tuesday. I had a cough that has lessened, and I don't have much chest congestion thankfully. Now, I can't tell if I'm scaring myself into thinking I'm short of breath, or ACTUALLY short of breath. I work in an ER so I'm seeing this firsthand. I don't want to go get admitted unless this is a really severe case but I also don't want to minimize it. Has anyone in this group had covid and .. recovered well? I don't want to get too excited that my symptoms are seemingly mild, and suddenly take a turn. I am also vaccinated, just didn't get a booster.",

They tested negative this morning. It looks like there's no smart way to let them come anyway but I am trying to see if there's anything we are missing. Everyone in the house has at least 2 doses, the immunocompromised person has 3 doses more than 14 days from becoming immunocompromised. The immunocompromised person could self isolate, keep window open, use a separate fridge and bathroom until they all go back home. BUT it's possible they could give the virus to a 5yo who would then have to stay home from preschool for 10 days, which would be a big burden as the person who would be watching him is the immunocompromised person.",

Since then, shes become pretty sick. I spent quite a bit of time with her on Monday and Tuesday - unmasked. Not only are we co-workers but were also sort of buddies. I immediately tested on Tuesday and came back negative. However, if I was exposed to her on Monday or Tuesday, then it most likely wouldnt show up. I am getting tested again tonight (Thursday). However, I have a flight out tomorrow to visit my parents for the week. My parents are in their early to mid 60s. They are in good health, except my mom isnt vaccinated. I am now faced with this situation where I could potentially test positive here in the next couple of days. I dont want to risk it to my parents but they say they dont care, its worth the risk to them. I told them thats not the point, you may not care but if something happens I will be the one to deal with it. The other thought going through my mind is that I havent seen my mom in forever and I dont want to stay separated from them forever. I would be destroyed if something happened to them and I havent seen them in years. However, I could cause the same thing by traveling. My gut says I shouldnt. Its not worth the risk. But I am also feeling the pressure (particularly from my dad) to come home. I want to so bad and I know statistically speaking nothing drastic is likely to happen but I just want to do the right thing. This on top of the general risk of contracting the virus in the airport. Any advice?",

        "Reddit Post": "From what I've noticed reading a lot of testimonials about fully vaccinated people testing positive for covid in the wake of the Omicron variant, how many of them, despite not being very sick, always say how horrible they feel for getting the virus in the first place and they essentially beat themselves up for getting covid. Despite being vaccinated, people still view getting covid as some kind of moral failing when it really isn't. Covid is a virus that's still circulating worldwide, so testing positive for it isn't something to be totally surprised by. I really dont think there should be a stigma around testing positive for covid in the post-vaccine era. I know that there is always the question of \"what if I get an unvaccinated immunocompromised person sick?\" thats not the same thing as shooting them point blank in the head with a gun, and secondly, theres no reason why immunocompromised people should be walking around completely immune naive against covid, simply being immunocompromised isn't a reason to not get vaccinated, if anything it's a reason **TO** get vaccinated. Anyway, the point of this is to say, just because you test positive for breakthrough covid doesn't mean you're an inherently bad or selfish person. Things happen.",

I have been testing us all frequently with BinaxNow kits and all tests have been negative except for a very very faint positive for the oldest kid on Wednesday morning. We were all very crushed with Christmas and all but I was also very worried for my kids. However, she took another test today (from the same box the positive test came out of) and to my confusion it was negative again as was mine and the youngest kid.

        "Reddit Post": "I'm in Ontario btw. 25/F live with my parents. We never do much for Christmas but our usual plan is to exchange gifts with my aunt and cousin and go to the movies. We're scheduled for our boosters on Dec 28 (me) and Dec 30 (my parents) and we all either work from home or are retired. I also have school but idk how that will work now. I want to avoid being exposed before then (and maybe for a week or so after) so that I don't get symptoms and have to give up my appointment. So I suggested we go for a nice walk in nature tomorrow instead of the movie, and when we exchange gifts with others outside our household we all wear masks. My parents are planning to go to the movie even if I don't go, so I would still end up getting covid if they picked it up. And my mom is complaining about not wanting to wear a mask with someone in our \"bubble\" (even though my aunt is interacting with her BF and his family as well). I've straight-up told my parents I would resent them if they did end up picking it up (I don't deal with illness well and with the whole having to isolate for over a week thing I know I'd go stir crazy and turn into an absolute monster). Should I isolate in my room as much as possible until I get the booster (it's only a few days)? Or should I just live my life because we're probably going to lock back down here soon anyway?",

We're still here, however close we are to losing our minds, and that's something that's so significant. We've fought our minds and won. Plenty of us (absolutely me included) will be having waves of hopelessness and fear that come and go and recede a little then rear up again and smack us one. And that's alright - what we've been through would definitely class as trauma, especially if you've had difficult circumstances, personal encounters with COVID, or supportive interactions cancelled. We shouldn't expect to feel unscathed after all of that. But no matter how hard it gets, try to remember that there's been plenty of positive studies released about the current situation (which yes, we know they have caveats, but their presence is an amazing positive compared to their absence). Also remember that absolutely everything in life is temporary - you won't feel this way forever. (And even if you don't believe it right now, it's still going to be true regardless.) I know this Christmas will be difficult - bad times can be amplified when you feel like you should be feeling good. But if you can, try to step away from the news for a while (all the stories will still be there when you get back) and do something that makes you happy or switch off from the world - eat good food, talk to someone, play a video game, sleep for twelve hours. Don't be afraid to mope or cry or pretend it's not the holidays, either. But either way, you're gonna get through Christmas, and you're gonna get through the next few months of COVID, and then you're gonna get through whatever comes next, and you'll look back and realise you're so far in the future away from your worst moments and it'll feel like no time has passed at all. You're doing great. Keep going.",

She opened the door without her mask on (she put one on shortly after) and had a conversation (albeit very brief! 2-3 minutes max and only a few words shared) with my dad (unmasked but fully vaxxed and boosted) outside. Probably 2 metres apart, maybe a little less. She also handed him some gifts. My mom and I were also there but we stood far away. Would you all consider this a high-risk exposure? mostly concerned about the brief contact made when handing gifts over. He did use hand sanitizer right after.",

I must also mention that I was on immunosuppressants and biologicals for my Ankylosing Spondylitis when I contracted COVID. However, my sense of taste and smell is still distorted. Almost nothing smells and tastes how it is supposed to (except for the sweet/sugary stuff). Every doctor I consulted said that it would return naturally and that I should just wait. I waited patiently for 9 months now and it really is starting to bother me now. would be really grateful if anyone of you knows how to go about curing this.

He says it helps with his grief which I totally understand. He works as a massage therapist which scares the hell out of me. He's in a small room with a client for 2 hours at a time up-close since that's how massages tend to be. He agreed to suspend his practice in January because of the surge in cases but he's still going to see clients this coming week. I'm pulling my hair out because that's when I think the upcoming surge is going to be at its worst with people spreading it from Christmas gatherings. It drives me crazy to read stuff on here sometimes because I totally understand that, for most of us Covid is not a serious threat. However, my father is in the dangerous age range for this stuff. Every time I see a \"positive\" headline or news story they always throw in the \"except for those over 65\". I'm not worried about myself, I'm worried about him! Now a few things I should point out; * He wears a mask and requires all clients wear one as well, even though his mask is a weird, hand-made tripple-filter carbon filter/ cotton/ silk thing. * He just got his booster mid-November and requires all clients to be vaccinated and postpone sessions if they have traveled on a flight. * I don't want to jinx anything but for 70 he seems very healthy. He's always outside lugging stones and wood around the yard and doesn't have any other health issues that I know of. I just lost my mom and I don't think I could go on if I lost him now. I'm usually pretty optomistic about all the Covid stuff *unless* it relates to my Dad.",

I'm confused about whether to believe them or not - it seems like a good portion of the population will get it eventually and it'll be more like a quick cold than anything, but I'm not sure whether this means EVERY SINGLE PERSON will inevitably catch it sometime in the near future. I've been sick twice over the past two months (not COVID), and it still absolutely sucked for my parents and I to have to wear masks in the house because there's nowhere in our house where I could properly isolate. I really don't want to have to go through that again anytime soon. Plus, my grandpa is 90 years old and if he catches it I'm not sure whether he'd be able to survive, even though he got his booster shot a while ago. We just lost my grandma two months ago and I don't want to lose him so soon too. Can someone help clarify plz??",

I've been stuck in what seems like a time loop without an escape for the last 2 years, what I once thought was a bit of time off from the big city life has turned into 2 years of me essentially living like a sloth. Since then I've sold my flat and put down the deposit for a new one, one that'd be more spacious and perfect fro working from home. The city I used to work in/from is about 1.2k km away and, although I had sort of adjusted to this small village vibe I feel like it's just not who I am, then again I'm also somewhat afraid I won't be able to go back and live life as I once did without my loved ones around me, but I just don't feel like I belong here. Back in the day I at least had the excuse of having to live so far away because of work, but now I feel like I want to go back just because: it wouldn't be going back as much as trying in a way to move forward. Sure I am a bit worried I might catch it, but my appointment for my third jab is in 2 weeks and hopefully after that I'll be able to look at things in a more positive way, there's still a part of me though that dreads the thought of going back and going back to an old me, but I just feel this urge, this pull I'm finding really hard to resist.

I have mostly isolated myself throughout the pandemic, and public places/indoor spaces/seeing friends have been really difficult for me. Omicron has been spreading rapidly in my city and it's raised my covid anxiety to a new level. I feel really anxious about leaving my apartment for any reason. I have to go into the pharmacy on Monday to get my booster shot, but I feel so anxious about catching covid while I am getting vaccinated, and the thought of having to go inside a pharmacy honestly fills me with dread. I know a lot of my covid anxiety is probably intrusive thoughts, but that knowledge doesn't make it any easier to cope with. The anxiety was starting get better in the summer and fall, but it feels like omicron has brought me back to square one. I guess I'm just looking for support and ways to cope with the anxiety of getting my booster shot on monday - both during and after. Beyond double masking, social distancing, and good hygiene, what else can I do to be as safe as possible? Thank you to all",

My flight home from the UK to Canada was on Thursday, and Wednesday morning I tested positive on a PCR needed for entry into Canada. I had pretty mild symptoms at the beginning, just kind of slight tiredness and maybe a slightly high temperature.... and I am double-vaxxed <ORG> but last dose was 6/16. Of course there is no definite answer, but around when can I expect to test negative on a PCR? It has been 4 days since my test now and I am feeling fine with no symptoms. Is it possible I keep testing positive? I know I can re-enter Canada after 14 days anyway but I'd like to see my family for the holidays sooner than that. Also- is it possible I test positive on antigen but not PCR (I can do antigens everyday, was just gonna keep doing them and then immediately order same day PCR when I am neg)",

It's something I've wanted to do for a while now and was planning on joining a gym in 2020, but we know how that went... Most gyms in my area have opened back up with guidelines of \"if you are not vaccinated you need to wear a mask,\" but frankly, I don't trust people to be honest about their status and the BJJ crowd seems like the type to shy away from the vaccine (plus wearing a mask seems worthless in that situation). As we've seen with OMICRON, even vaxxed folks can easily catch it. So will BJJ ever be a safe activity to do? Keep in mind that I plan on keeping up do date with my boosters and everything else I can to be safe. I'll also add that I have had COVID already and while it wasn't that bad, I'm mostly worried about the long term consequences and future variants.",

Shes disabled and Im her carer as well as an essential worker and forever Ive been keeping my distance from her, doing everything right and she still came down with it. Right now, as mums do, shes playing it down, even though I can hear her coughing, and shes cold and hot and Ive put Vicks on her and everything else, but this could take her. And Im so scared that I gave her it. Shes downplaying it, but Im terrified and am not dealing well with it. Im feeling ok, a hell of a headache, but nothing to be concerned about right now. Since I was a teenager, Im 42 now Ive had to deal with the fact that due to her issues I could lose her at some point. My dad died from cancer a few years ago, but it came from me. I did this, I feel like my siblings havent said anything but they are blaming me too Anyone else going through this, anyways ways I can stop feeling like this Please",

But still, I fear the inevitable FOMO if my university goes remote for the entire spring semester, while my friends at other universities are still in person. My university wont announce anything until early January as per the update last week, but still what if they say theyll return to in person like after two weeks then extend online learning right after tuition is due? I know alot of people at my university and other ones fear this possibility. More and more universities in the US and Canada are going remote for at least the start of their spring semesters, but theres a growing fear that the entire spring semester goes virtual. Its a tough decision for sure. Do I transfer to avoid a potential remote semester for the sake of my mental health but leave behind all my friends, or do I stay where Im at and be with my friends but at the risk of a remote semester?",

I think he may have been exposed before the trip (between 12/9-12/13). Some of the people he was working with tested positive while we were on our trip. Does that timeline sound about right for him to start experiencing symptoms starting 12/24? He woke up Christmas Eve and felt awful full on symptoms of what I thought to be the flu but with a negative COVID test. The next day, he tested twice both with super faint positive lines. 12/26, the positive line was darker. The only other time he would have been exposed was 12/22 when he was with someone that texted and told him they tested positive. But Im not sure if the onset of the symptoms would have happened that quickly. I guess my real question here is: Has anyone gotten COVID (tested positive and everything) and then gotten a negative test within a few days? Also, has anyone experience getting a false positive test OR anyone know if you can test positive even if its just the flu? I took a test and was negative and am feeling fine. I was sure it was just the flu because I am vaccinated against it and hes not. Lastly, and I know this is a dumb question so dont attack me How soon after he tests negative can I go see him? Were both kind of hoping/holding out for him to be negative by NYE. Super selfish, again, dont attack me. Its just wishful thinking and Im just trying to understand a timeline and hear other peoples experiences. Im curious to know if anyone has gotten over it in a shorter amount of time than others. Hes healthy otherwise and vaccinated (which I know means little at this point). Once he tests negative (even if before the recommended 10 days), if I go see him, is there still a huge risk? \\*\\*His symptoms as of now are: on and off fever, fatigue, GI upset (he threw up once and has had weird stomach stuff sometimes otherwise), stuffy nose (new), cough with green phlegm (getting better), headache, body aches he actually looks and sounds good for being sick. No loss of smell/taste, good appetite, breathing is fine (and no chest pain).",

Of course, that is easy to see considering how Omicron is seemingly mild and we have vaccines in our arsenal, however, I'm curious about what you guys think about the Omicron variant being the \"final\" variant? Of course, I don't think Omicron will actually be the last variant because there WILL be more variants in the future, but hopefully it's when the pandemic finally turns into an endemic where future variants are even far more mild. However, do you guys think it's likely the Omicron could be the final variant that will raise any sort of concern and/or fearmongering from the media? Also, what are the possibilities of a variant far more deadlier than Delta emerging? Just curious, no need to sugar coat anything.",

That said, the new Omicron variant is making its way through the staff of about 6 we have on site. A lot of my co-workers are now out for 2 weeks, and I find myself with all the overtime I could ever want. And just in time, too, because the holiday bills are catching up. 4 of the 6 employees have it, leaving just myself and one night-shift guy. The two of us are the only ones that have been vaccinated. My wife woke up this morning with a headache and fever. Her fever was only 99.8 (just under 100 degrees F). My stepson, a 20-year-old all-knowing anti-vaxxer himself, also had a fever. His was 103, a bit more severe. They both went to get tested, and are both positive. This means I likely have it, or am a carrier. I just took my own temperature, it's 99.2, so yeah - I probably was infected. My question - looking at all of this well-needed overtime, and considering that the entire staff has already been exposed, should I go home and let my manager figure out how to cover these shifts? My vaccination status tells me my symptoms will not be severe, and that seems to be the case so far. I really need the money, and nobody else is likely to get sick except the night-shift guy. Would YOU call your manager, let him know, and give up all that sweet, sweet overtime pay?",

        "Reddit Post": "I've taken so many precautions throughout this whole thing and have thankfully not had any known exposure scares. This Christmas I got my booster and my whole family was not sick and fully vaccinated, save for the small children. Yesterday though I got a distressing text from my aunt, saying that one of the kids came back positive from a pcr test from a week ago. Apparently his dad lied that the negative result from the day before we gathered was from a pcr, and actually came from a rapid home test. (Can I add that I hate how inconsistent and unreliable all these tests seem to be?) The kid apparently had some mild symptoms about a week before christmas and promptly got tested, and the doctor didn't think it was covid. Nobody informed us about this. If I had known I wouldn't have taken the chance What's worse, I went to the gathering with some family friends, and they're much more concerned about this, so they wanted everyone to test negative in some capacity. I did with a home test, but that was only a day after the (at the time unaware) exposure. And I feel so guilty and don't know what to say And what's WORSE worse, is I have both a small new years eve hangout at a friend's house and a convention coming up very shortly. I'm trying to find a pcr test, but everywhere is booked solid. I don't have any symptoms, but I'm so devastated. I can miss out on the hangout, but the convention we've pouted a lot of money and planning into. I have no idea where to even go from here",

Am I \"immune\" for 90 days now? Does this mean that if I'm in an environment where someone else tests positive within that time period, I don't have to react? Or would I still have to quarantine before seeing others because I can still infect through the new exposure? Also, when it comes to getting tested for COVID post quarantine, won't I still test positive for up to 3 months on both PCR and rapid? I have 3 of my shots, I got boosted over Thanksgiving.

Simply because me as a 31yr old is feeling almost normal now after 4 days, and my 22 yr old gf has been to the hospital twice for fluids or naseau help. My question is, my girlfriend really wants me to pick her up. Obviously we both have covid, so that's fine. My concern is, I am really hoping to go back to work next Monday, 7 days from now, If a test later in the week shows I'm negative. If I'm already over the curve, and my lingering symptoms or just general blah, no smell, limited taste, and I bring my girlfriend over who is still knee deep in covid with having cough attacks and throwing up everything she eats or drinks, is this going to mess me up with my test results later in the week? Is this going to prohibit me from going back to work next week? Or will I be good, despite her here, me with just leftover lingering effects that take weeks to dissipate (sense of smell for example) while she's still getting over hurdles? At this point, it's still considered me being exposed and everything, so I couldn't go back to work even if I tested negative, right? Or I mean, I just need clarification here guys",

We still cleaned up after him, mostly isolated from him and all that jazz. Hes better now, except this happens... Come to wake up this morning, and I get the chills, my head aches I even have a cough going on. My Moms also not doing so hot as well. I might get tested, but I think Ive got COVID now. What the fuck??? Why us??? Why did we get it? Why has this pandemic still been going on? Why omnicron? Why new variants overall? Why are the vacccinated now getting it??? And now were seeing Omicrom becoming big, but then Im hearing that South Africa and the UK has been doing better, and that the variant isnt as devastating, but Im not so sure. How are they doing better under a not so bad variant when Im now hearing that hospitals are getting towards overcapacity. Why do I we still feel icky and nasty under this better variant??? What if I have long-COVID now despite my efforts? Im getting really scared, Im angry (Im fucking vaccinated, this shouldnt be happening), and Im confused. Has anyone else gotten omicron? Will we be OK? Whats going on?",

He became uncomfortable with the number of people he ended up being around and took an at-home test which was positive. He's currently asymptomatic but has returned to our place. I'm just worried about when I can return home now. The CDC said positive people should isolate for 5 days instead of 10 but if it's only motivated by needing people back to work then is it the right advice to follow? Am I being overly cautious by even worrying so much or am I being selfish by not wanting extra time away from him and my home? I'm just really tired, feel like I'm hitting my pandemic wall for the 10th time. Additional info: we're both in our 30s and boosted. Our family members are boosted too. Neither of us would need to leave the apartment if we were there.",

I had a breakthrough covid case in early August (he somehow didn't catch it). I realize that doesn't mean you shouldn't get a shot (just sharing for background). We are both young and pretty healthy: exercise regularly, eat well, no conditions to note. I work from home full time, and so does my husband, so we aren't exposed to many people in our day-to-day lives. We live in the US and were invited to a wedding abroad in February (if it still happens - the couple has postponed three times already and are very eager to move forward). It sounds like booster protection wanes in about 10 weeks. Even before that had come out, we discussed if we should hold off on our booster until 2-3 weeks before our trip so our protection will be at its strongest. That would put us at mid-January for the optimal shot timing, so just a couple of weeks from now. I don't know - it seems kind of like we're making up our own rules, but it could also be a good idea? At the same time there's so much unknown: What if institutions start mandating boosters? What if we get omicron before we can get our boosters? Are we being stupid about this?",

We will know for sure in about 2 weeks, with the surge just starting, but so far it's looking like it's by far the mildest variant so far. Up to this point we'd been (somewhat) suppressing Covid through measures, the vaccine, and immunity gained from having Covid which put an evolutionary pressure on Covid to mutate once again so it can become effective again. If this truly ends up being as mild as the seasonal Flu, shouldn't we encourage this one to be the one that embeds into our society? Until we figure out anti-viral science entirely, isn't that the best we can do? I genuinely fear that being too effective against Omicron might end in a worse variant taking on the pressure, which is what we don't want. I know that this kind of thinking might sound weird though, which is why I'm asking it here.",

I have received some positive response, but also negative response. The response tends to range from \"It's only comparatively better to dying,\" to \"You're selfish for being anti-science and you will kill somebody.\" I've found that some people I know enjoy mentioning their ultra-compliance to self-imposed COVID restrictions and lauding anybody they see not wearing a mask outside when not even close to anyone else. It's like when the anti-mask, anti-vax crowed politicized the virus they made it entirely necessary for anyone opposite them on the political spectrum to adopt eternal draconian COVID tenets as a part of their political identity. Then we have the crowd that never really enjoyed seeing people anyway and have been looking forward to a global catastrophe like this to spur our transition from living life in person to living life virtually in perpetuity. A pandemic ends once everyone is on board with it having ended. If the next mutation literally was a cold I have no doubt that everyone would be pissed at the CDC to say so, there would still be a lot of people (especially social media influencers chasing clout by spouting extremized rhetoric to an impressionable audience) saying that it is selfish to socialize when the virus is still with us, we need to continue to blame others for the virus still being around, you need to wear your mask everywhere, etc. I'm building a strawman, I know, but it is a hypothetical not entirely without some experience to back it up. So all that said, things are eventually going to get better. Is everybody going to be able to accept when it does?

My legs were just weak and my knees hurt, a lot. I woke up in the middle of the night, shivering uncontrollably to the point where working the buttons on the oven and letting out the dog was like working with Parkinson's disease - shaky, shaky. That seems to have passed, but my nose is stuffy, my eyes are burning, I ache all over, to touch my skin hurts, I am nauseous, and have a headache. I've taken Tylenol, but does anyone have any other tips for getting over the hump? I am trying to WFH today, but everything hurts and I just want to lie down and not move. In spite of that, I am happy to have been able to get a booster, which are in pretty tight supply at the moment. I am especially glad to be boosted because omnicron variant is all around me. I bailed on our family dinner on Christmas because the original plan was for 18 people and Public Health had just mandated no gatherings of more than 10 people. I pulled out my family of 5 and they were still planning on going ahead with an illegal number of attendees, 13, and everyone was pushing us to attend. I held firm and I am glad I did, because the dinner was cancelled last minute when the hosts were made aware they were close contacts of a known infection. Having been exposed, they are now quite ill. I am so ready for Covid to be in the past...",

The UK has implemented something similar recently.

Theres no avoiding infection, which is saddening. I dont really know what to do, if there is much to be done. I stay masked where I go and do what I can, but it is draining.",

My older sister, who works at a big retail center, recently tested positive for Covid which is a big problem for a multitude of reasons. The **7** of us live in a small 3 bedroom house which makes isolating difficult. My older sister and I are the only people in the household that are vaccinated and despite my sister (who has not self isolated herself and continues to roam freely about the house sometimes unmasked) testing positive refuses to get tested herself/test my younger siblings. My sister and mother are the only people with working vehicles so arranging for myself and younger siblings to get tested would be difficult. On top of that I was recently hired at a small retail store and was set to start work very soon and although I am worried about how it will effect my hours and seeming \"unreliable\" before I actually start my job I don't feel comfortable going into work knowing I've been in contact with someone who has tested positive. At this point I've accepted that I probably have it and it doesn't seem like anyone else in my family is going to be making any substantial changes to their routine despite my sister testing positive. I figuratively and physically feel stuck and any advice is welcome.",

We're all vaccinated, boosted, and have been isolating as best as we can for the week leading up to it, and we're all going to rapid test shortly before entering. Because I'm currently living with my parents, both of whom are a little older (72 and 64), I'm planning on isolating myself in an Airbnb afterwards until the morning of the 5th so that hopefully enough time will have passed so that I'll know whether or not I have it, be it through symptoms or the lack thereof, as well as a rapid test. My question is: given all of this, does four and a half days past the potential exposure point sound like a reasonable isolation time before going back to my parents' place? My parents aren't stressed about my plan at all--they're both vaxxed and boosted--but I just want to have all my bases covered, and was a little confused about the incubation time. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",

I know this is probably just my irrational mind, but part of me fears that my university wont make a balanced decision and go far too restrictive, like putting the entire semester remote right off the bat even if e.g. things get better around springtime. Like the possibility they dont make a good cost-benefit analysis and overreact in their decision. Once again I know this is most likely irrational but just need some support in this uncertain time.

When my mom pick me up for work, I told her that I hope this pandemic will end for sure next year, but my mom says \"there is no for sure, it might not end next year.\" She's not doing this to make me feel miserable. She knows the pandemic will end. But she says \"you can still optimistic, but you need to do it cautiously.\" I guess I said the pandemic won't end next year and keep losing hope because I'm confused. I just wanted the pandemic to end badly, so we can go back to normal lives. I even talk to my Dad that I think the 2020s will be the worst decade, but he said \"As long as it's not like World War I or World War 2, we're okay.\" So I guess keep losing hope, because I just don't understand. Do you guys think I maybe overly optimistic? If the vaccines or pills won't end the pandemic, then what else is there? How do we know when the pandemic ends if it's going to end next year or not?

Since folks might ask, I'm 30F, technically obsese BMI, no major pre-existing symptoms aside from borderline high blood pressure/anxiety. However now I'm on week 4 and still feeling weird. Like my heart is still beating erratically at times, I'm having brain fog to the point where I don't remember how do to simple things, I'm thinking slow, depersonalization, depression, and mood swings. I can't sleep, and 3am feels like it might as well be 3pm. I just don't feel like myself. I still have weird nerve sensations in my arms and face and legs. I still get out of breath just walking my dog. I'm just now starting to get taste back but unfortunately everything tastes bad, like sewage, which is almost worse than not being able to taste at all. I'm so incredibly frustrated. I feel so...dumb and tired and its exhausting. I can't see a doctor for another month as they are so backlogged. My question is for anyone else who has gone through this was there anything that helped you get through it? I feel like I'm going crazy and I'm not myself. Any supplements or therapy you can recommend would be helpful. It's frustrating to see people say it's just a cold and are over it in 3 days when I'm still struggling with simple tasks. I'm more determined than ever to lose extra weight since I'm sure that's a contributing factor but I'm hoping there's a light at the end of this tunnel. Thanks!",

My question is this: why arent we, as richer nations (Im assuming that most individuals here are from richer nations), doing this? Its why these more transmissible strains (Delta and Omicron) were allowed to even fester. Ontario and Manitoba are now considering 4th doses for individuals. If we postponed the booster campaigns in richer countries and started ramping up 1st and 2nd doses in poorer countries, this pandemic could be over by now. At this rate well forever be in a pandemic because countries like Canada, the US, the UK, et al refuse to get poorer countries the Covid vaccine doses that they need.",

Now that I am vaccinated, I would like to know if there are any general rules or ways to decide what things I should or shouldn't do, particularly with the new variants, such as the Omicron variant going around. I am 21 years old and am not in an at-risk group, and I live with mother and grandparents, who got vaccinated with the <ORG> vaccine last year. &amp;#x200B; 1. Can I, for example, play table tennis without me or my coach wearing a mask? I play indoors, it's a small space that is empty most of the time and my coach is vaccinated. But unvaccinated people could walk in the table tennis area any time. 2. Do I still need to wash my hands for 60 seconds every time I receive a package at our house, or would that be overkill? 3. We have a walking area where I live, most people there don't wear masks and I don't know if they are vaccinated, would it be safe for me to go and walk amidst them while wearing a mask? 4. Is it safe for me to go to restaurants? 5. I read that the protection from the vaccine wanes over time. If it is safe for me to go out, assuming that I can't get a booster, how long is it safe before the protection will decrease to the point where I need to stay home, and avoid going out again? 6. Should I isolate everytime I feel feverish or get a fever, or everytime I meet someone, and later find out that they got a fever? 7. Should I be worried about long covid, I read a [post]([url] here about a vaccinated person who got brain fog after getting COVID, should I be worried about this? 8. Are there any general rules or things to keep in mind to help me make these decisions? Like before the vaccine, there were guidelines such as maintaining a distance of six feet and avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands for 20/60 seconds, avoiding being indoors with other people when possible, etc. I'm not sure what precautions I can stop taking and which ones are still very important.

And the thing is even if this does \"end\" anytime soon (I have a hard time believing it will before 2024) there's gonna be some other disaster, prolly climate related, that's gonna make the next \"era\" feel like hell too. It was the same for most of my life, either something was terrible personally or politically and there was no true peace. So should I just assume things are going to stay like this for a long time and plan my future based on that? I've been putting things \"on hold\", should I just be changing those plans entirely at this point?

Both of them exercise very regularly: my dad is 52 and my sister is 14. My sister has not gotten the booster of course due to her age, but my dad refuses to get it. This part has worried me since the beginning; he does not see the point of getting vaccinated and he frequently goes out. To make things worse, his job requires close contact with people and he relies too much on his immune. Ive tried so many times but I have no idea what else I can do. He doesnt like to listen, but he would usually hear me out if I start crying(according to my sister). I had already left his place in tears leaving him confused, and I am wondering if Im being over dramatic about this. Im glad theyre both choosing to take more precautions and take it more seriously, but I just want them to get better. When I try to look up news/information, I become more overwhelmed and confused as to how deadly this virus/variant is and where we are as a country. And I keep worrying about whether my dads age will affect him too much and how possible is it for both of them to have a good recovery. I understand this is not just your common sickness, but I just cant stop worryingI never knew I would feel this way, especially when winter break was supposed to be relaxing for all of us.",

But by the night time it was all gone and i almost thought i am symptom free. Because i literally had no symptoms left and my appetite also got better which resulted in me eating a nice meal instead of eating just a piece of bread all day every 5 hours. Anyways today on day 2 all of the symptoms came back.The fever,chils,body aches, and the sore throat is so insane and worse than ever since i got covid. As of writing this post the fever looks good again but the sore throat is killing me and my appetite has gone down again. Fever is something that comes and goes every 4,5 hours but sore throat is pretty much there and got worse actually.Is the sore throat normal while recovering? thanks",

For starters I will share what I will be doing 1. I will unsub to r/coronavirus therefore making this subreddit my only subscription. I feel like removing all the overreacting media articles and the bad news off my reddit feed will be great plus all the trolls on there that want this pandemic to last forever. 2. Second I will keep the global vaccination tracker as a temporary tab on my computer to check daily. If we are going to end this we must end it globally. Going into 2022 with both these changes will make me feel good throughout the year and hopefully we will all reach pandemics end. This also means I will be 100% active on this sub only. The coronavirus sub is seriously something else. Feel free to share your covid changes for the new year.",

I have some pretty severe health anxiety so obviously the pandemic has been a literal nightmare for me (as I am sure it has been for everyone else, regardless lol). I finally got a job I love and had to bite the bullet of being in contact with strangers and handling money etc. Until boxing week (its fucking MENTAL during boxing week where I work) I had actually felt very good about rona and felt very confident that I was safe- then I was surrounded by people in an at capacity store for 10+ hours for almost a week straight and got anxious. Fast forward one co worker has tested positive and now my sister has as well (unrelated to my place of work, she and her roommate caught it from someone over Christmas). Im honestly very nervous and people all around me keep talking about omicron and how all of us are just getting it left and right. It feels so close to home and Im worried for my sister (not in an at risk group and is double vaxxed although not boosted yet). I myself am also double vaxxed but not boosted. Anyways, Im rambling but I guess I just needed to vent it out since I have to somehow get sleep tonight before I go back into work tomorrow for the last couple of days before boxing week ends. Like everyone else, Im just so tired of covid and sick of being so anxious and aware of it 24/7. Hope everyone else is doing okay &lt;3",

I live in the sf bay area which has been frustrating because we're super strict about covid which has made making friends much more difficult. Yet even though we're doing everything right we're still having record breaking cases. Things are getting canceled again just like March 2020. And more people are now less willing to meet new people or even people they already know. Over the summer and fall I tried going to meetup groups to meet new people and I never could really find the right group of people. And now it looks like I'll have to wait till the summer to even be able to try and find new friends again. I spoke to my therapist about my struggles to find people I can connect well with and she told me because I'm not willing to do zoom calls I'm probably not gonna get anywhere towards making new friends for a long time. And one of my closest friends got upset at me for going to EDC Orlando last month and going to Disneyland with my mom last week. I was scared to even post that I went to edc Orlando a month ago because my friend wouldn't approve of it. I still have a super hard time convincing myself that 2022 will be any better. Or that if I lost my life I would be missed by other people. I also fear that people will be even less willing to go back to normal post omicron because of trauma from getting sick with covid.",

        "Reddit Post": "I have been an ardent pro-vaccine advocate the entire past year. I urged my family to all get their boosters ASAP. My younger brother just got his booster a few days ago. Since then, he has been experiencing chest pain, dizziness, almost lost consciousness a few times, and shortness of breath. Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.",

I started getting symptoms on the 19th and have isolated entirely on my own since. My isolation then ended on the 29th (not 7 days as I was still testing positive). I'm still testing positive but from what I make out, it doesn't matter, I'm allowed to end my isolation as I've no major symptoms etc. This is where it gets complicated. My flat mate has just returned from his parents and has done a test today and he is now positive. Does this mean I now have to isolate again until he is negative? From what I've read, I do as I'm unvaccinated but can someone confirm this? I haven't seen my son or family since 19th Dec so I'm just really frustrated and need clear answers as I'm reading so much conflicting info and his mum is being an absolute nightmare about it all telling me I need to test negative before I see him (which is just stupid imo as I've isolated 11 days).",

I decided to get tested that same day and got my results about 36hrs later, and it was negative. At the time, I was pretty fatigued and I felt like I was going to fall asleep during dinner and I had a weird slimy feeling in my throat, so nothing major. These \"symptoms\" haven't really changed, so I decided to test myself yesterday with an antigen rapid test kit and it came out positive. So what should I even believe? The PCR test results was 3 days after the gathering, and the Antigen Rapid Test kit I did was yesterday. One could be false positive and the other one could be false negative. Should I assume the Rapid Test kit is wrong since I always hear they are inaccurate? Regardless, I'm still quarantining myself for 2 weeks.",

I (24 F, 3X vaxxed) went a family gathering on 12/24 (my first family event since COVID began), started feeling sick on 12/26. By 12/27 I had a full-blown sore throat, fever, chills, &amp; difficulty breathing. Standing to do dishes became impossible. Found out on 12/29 that *4* family members (of maybe 15 total in attendance) had tested positive since the gathering, all starting to feel sick on 12/26 as well, &amp; they happen to be the ones I spent the most time near. At this point, my symptoms change every day - today is headache, trouble breathing, runny nose, etc. I've had pretty much every symptom except loss of taste or smell. Testing kits are non-existent where I live at this point. Earliest testing appt. was 12/29 for a PCR test through Project Baseline (Rite-Aid) &amp; I received my results this evening - negative for COVID. At first I was relieved, but I'm having a hard time believing that what I'm experiencing is anything but COVID when A) I was in an environment where somebody was clearly infectious &amp; in close contact with family, &amp; B) I've never felt an illness quite like this in my life. Seriously, everything feels like an effort! I've never quite struggled to breathe like this (Also, negative for flu) The earliest testing appointment anywhere near me is 1/6. I intend on testing again but have little hope for answers, honestly, thinking this is pretty far out from exposure date. How should I interpret this negative result? Am I super paranoid or was the time frame in which I got tested too soon/late? All thoughts welcome!",

        "Reddit Post": "Tested a strong positive with an at home rapid test. Husband is fully vaccinated and boosted and was negative, has no symptoms. Our son was positive but only threw up one day, fever for a day, and was fatigued for two days. Hes totally back to normal and had totally different symptoms then me. My symptoms: Day 1: headache and scratchy throat Day 2: nasal congestion, scratchy throat, dry cough (more irritating, like a tickle that comes and goes) Day 3: nasal congestion, dry cough Day 4: nasal congestion, dry cough Day 5 (today): less nasal congestion, dry cough almost completely gone, but NEW loss of taste and smell out of nowhere! I am shocked at how many symptoms I have even though Im double vaccinated and boosted. Im so sad I lost my taste and smell and Im scared when I can expect it back. Im seeing some scary stuff about people not having it return for a year or more. Anyone have some positive stories they can share? I could use some hope. I broke down today and cried (probably pregnancy hormones too) because I tried so hard to be careful the past two years and do everything to protect my family and others. Is this likely delta since I lost my sense of smell and taste?",

About 3 weeks ago my husband (m31) tested positive for Covid. He was very low on energy and slept ALOT for about a week. Finally, we noticed his oxygen saturation was dropping off and on. On day 7 of him being positive, his oxygen saturation dropped to 83. So, we had him sent to the hospital via ambulance. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days. After a day and a half he was bumped from 5 liters of oxygen to a heated high flow 50 liters. He stayed on that for about 3 days and then they slowly decreased. He was discharged about a week ago, but he still has to use oxygen when he sleeps and sometimes throughout the day. His PCP says he needs to stick with it for at least another month. My husband is very determined to stop using it as much and he is pushing himself. I understand he doesnt want to use it forever, but his doctor says it will take one day at a time. I am hopeful that he will be able to come off of it soon, but I fear that my husband is rushing it. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!",

Since it's pretty hot over here, we thought It was a heatstroke until we did a covid test on her. Low and behold, she tested positive. My aunt also developed a cough last night and her baby daughter developed a fever today. I'm fully vaccinated and after days of being all around them and constantly exposed to it, I tested negative today while they tested positive. I'm fully vaccinated and actually had my run with covid March 2020 where the only thing I had was lost of taste and smell. I'm in a bit in a pickle right now because I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to wear a mask 24/7 in the place I'm staying at right now and my mom's insisting that since I've been exposed to it already, and tested negative that I'll be fine. I fly out by myself back home to cali on the 5th and really don't want to catch it so close to the time I'm leaving. My question is, what's the likelihood that I can still catch it if I haven't all this time? If they all have gotten symptoms around the same time, that means that that the incubation period started at the same time, which means either for some reason I somehow avoided it after all this time traveling and being together (unlikely), or I already had it before without knowing and that's why I tested negative. What do I do lol",

And now I'm so scared I will have to do the same, but still trying to be positive and manifest a good outcome. The day before Christmas, my own dad tested positive for covid, had typical cold symptoms, said he felt fine otherwise. I bought him an oximeter and yesterday he started feeling worse and his blood oxygen level was at 42% so I brought him to the hospital. He called me and sounded so scared and confused and asked me to come pick him up and bring him to the hospital. His healthcare team said it's an extreme case of covid and there is a high probability that he may be intubated. If he maxes out on the oxygen through his cannula, he will move to CPAP, and then to a vent. The doctor said he's now at a point where patients typically start to gradually improve, or take a sharp decline and have to end up on a vent, which has a 50% mortality rate for my dad's age. Thankfully his oxygen level is staying above 90% while he's got the cannula in and is thinking more clearly, etc. It could really go either way right now. I can't go see him, he can't really talk on the phone, I couldn't even wait with him in the ER waiting room. Just had to hug him real quick, tell him I love him, and then leave. Anyone else been here or had a family member in this position? Any tips to help him not panic to keep his breathing steady? Any tips for me and what I should be asking the doctors, etc? He is unmarried and I am the eldest child. I just can't imagine losing my father so young. He is only 50 and I am 26. Could use some words of encouragement and positive recovery stories.",

My brother remains focused on his uni assignments and exams despite omicron surge in his area and the threat that he may not be able to come back home for holiday due to stricter travel restrictions from the home country. On the other hand, here I was ruminating about how much money I would lose if I had to cancel the trip and whether I'll ever see my parents again, worrying everyday thinking this might be the day we go back to lockdown (and indeed that day happened), and a myriad of other things related to this bullshit. I'd like to ask them how they are not afraid, but I'm ashamed to reveal to them that I'm so weak mentally. I'm also afraid of being offended that they would downplay my anxiety. It's as if they don't have feelings. Sometimes I feel like I would kill just to have a little of their nonchalance or peace of mind. It's as if even if world war 3 happens, they wont give a damn.

Ontario is back in a lockdown mostly. Schools closed, most businesses shuttered. We're back at square fucking one and my anxiety and worst case scenarios proved to be RIGHT ALL ALONG. &amp;#x200B; I just feel completely underwater. I am teetering on the edge. This thing is just an endless cycle. I got my booster yesterday and felt nothing about it. I just said, well wel be back in 4 months to get the next one after this next lockdown lifts. &amp;#x200B; Im sorry Im spreading doom and gloom but I am just completely filled with it. I see no basis of anchor point of optimism to hold onto when this nightmare just keeps coming back. Maybe we'll have a nice august and september and then it'll be right back here for 2023. &amp;#x200B; I dont know what to do anymore. I legitimately feel like I am losing my mind. I'm truly sorry for my rambling over the past few months but I just have nowhere else to turn. I dont know how I am going to truly enjoy life ever again. I was 25 when this thing started and Im going to be 28.. and ill be god knows how old I be when its over. &amp;#x200B; Im sorry again. Im losing my shit.

I feel so confused and I don't know what to do. I feel like it's the right thing to just isolate but I'm tired of giving months of my life over to this virus while people go on having fun and I get left out and more distant from others. And of course, I'm disappointed that I've been waiting through this pandemic to get married and my partner gets omicron 2 weeks before our appointment date to sign the papers. My friend just took a trip to New York. The anime con is still on for next week. Meanwhile, cases have hit a record high. The cognitive dissonance is insane. Any advice or perspectives shared would be appreciated. I'm tired of feeling like I'm crazy and I have no idea what the responsible thing to do is anymore as life just goes on as normal.",

I didn't have a fever as a side effect for any of the doses. But I will say dose three did make my body sore. I had lots of aches, headache, and stiffness. I took advil extra strength, I know tylenol is recommended but I went with advil because it works better on me for pain relief. No fever and no nausea, just body pain and tiredness. I also couldn't really think straight due to the discomfort. So I just sat and did nothing the whole day until I felt better. It's day two, and I feel good.

I tested positive on Dec 14th, 20 days ago. After being cleared by my university on the 24th, I went to Europe to meet my family after a negative antigen from CVS. I lived my life like I had no fear of getting it anytime soon; nothing crazy just went to a small bar a couple of nights. Come Jan 1st, and I wake up with a slightly stuffy nose. Later that night, my sister, who I spent every second of the trip, tested positive for covid. After that moment I became extremely worried that my congestion was covid and it only got worse with flying back. I tested on the 2nd after my flight and my antigen came back positive. I freaked out. Can I have it again after only getting it 20 days ago, or is it just a false positive? Extra concerned as my antigen test on the 24th was negative and now my at-home one is positive. My congestion is now a bit worse, but I have no other symptoms like I did when I had covid for sure. Thank you in advance for any input you have!",

Immediately upon finding this out i took a rapid test and it was negative, and then today i took a PCR and am waiting for results. My mother with whom i'm staying with is severely immunocompromised (like had open heart surgery a year ago and one of her lungs doesnt work properly). So despite having been in in very close contact with her i am now distancing from her and everyone else in the house and wearing a mask. Then, today we discovered that a family member who was here on the 1st just tested positive on a rapid test today. So, i have a couple of questions cause we're all kind of freaking out right now. 1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)? 2) It is even possible for me to have transmitted covid to this family member who was here on the first? If i was carrying it, my time of contact with the virus would have been only 4 days prior. Is this enough time for me to have then transmitted it to someone else? 3) What exactly is safe to do in my house? Right now i am confining myself to either my bedroom (mask off) or in an adjacent bonus room (with a mask on). This room is fairly large, and a couple of people in the house pass through it a few times a day, generally passing about 15-20 feet away from me. How likely is it that i can pass the virus to them while being in this room, with a mask on? Thanks, appreciate any help i can get. Note: everyone in my family has 2 vaccines, my mother has had 3. Exactly how at risk of hospitalization/death is she? We're all deeply concerned.",

        "Reddit Post": "I'm living in the Netherlands and we're in full lockdown once again. I'm constantly trying to make sense why we're one of the only countries in full lockdown, and it seems at least partially due to our low ICU (critical care) capacity, meaning the potential for our hospitals to become overwhelmed is far higher than in other countries. Now, I've clung to the hope that pandemics in the end will end once enough people have contracted the virus / become vaccinated, but the following article worries me a bit: [[url] It says that getting the viruss reproductive number down to one is just the bare minimum for earning the endemic classification (instead of a pandemic), and the moment it stops being a threat will differ per country and depends on factors like hospital / ICU capacity. So since we had kind of a healthcare crisis even before the pandemic, I'm very worried that we might be stuck with restrictions way longer than other countries. Even before covid, in 2018 we had to postpone some operations due to a heavy flu season. The government planning \"long term strategies\" where we will indefinitely move large gatherings to the summer and \"stay low\" during the winter doesn't help either... Can anyone give some reassurance / thoughts? TLDR; I'm worried the problem with limited critical care in the Netherlands will keep us from moving beyond this crisis",

Not knowing if I would have to give birth alone or the hospital would take away my baby. We were in strict lockdown up until my husband and I could be vaccinated. We didn't go inside anywhere. I cried every day last winter. My son is very social and loves people and I couldn't give that to him. He would smile ear to ear at doctor appointments because he could finally see someone that wasn't my husband or me. Over the summer we started doing thing again, it was great. My son was so happy. We did something every day. We would walk around stores, grocery shop, eat out, and go to swim lessons. But it August with delta we started to self lock down again. Back to crying every day and trying to entertain a social toddler. Fast forward to the news that vaccines are actually a long ways away. I lost it mentally. Went full \"fuck it\" mode. Even with the massive surge going on right now. I started doing things again. Going to malls just to walk around with my son, going out to eat, and meeting with friends and family even if they do risky things. I'm pretty sure we haven't gotten sick yet. We all had a cold 3 weeks ago but tested negative on rapid tests so who knows. I'm just defeated. So this is my confession. I'm a bad parent and putting my son at risk. I don't have what it takes to entertain him at home. He loves saying hi to people he walks by. He smiles the entire time. He loves joining groups of kids and starts interacting with out missing a beat. I want to know what it's like being a parent with out being on the verge of a panic attack all the time or the massive guilt. And if I do stay in I'm not giving him that social interaction that he craves. I don't know, I just wanted to get all of this off my chest.",

I live in a southern state that does little to nothing in the university system to mitigate the spread of COVID. Up until this point I have not gotten it by wearing a mask in class despite being one of the only ones to do so and limiting my time on campus. That being said, last semester I somehow got mono and missed 4 weeks of school due to having post viral fatigue and also battled a kidney infection at the same time. The stress that put on me in terms of making up my schoolwork was crazy. I was thinking that maybe just maybe this semester COVID would die down even more but the transmission rate along with the new guidlines on isolation just seem like a recipe for disaster in an environment when people already dont care. In addition one of my classes is 3 hours long. Thats a long time to be exposed to people. I understand that its basically inevitable Im going to get it and whatever Im just feeling dissapointed and hopeless and dont want the stress of being sick to take me down again. Im also just frustrated that everyone seems to have given up on trying to control COVID even just a little bit. I know Im healthy otherwise and I wouldnt probably be severely ill due to be vaccinated and boosted its just annoying how it seems everyone has resigned to it.",

I said in 2020 that if by spring/summer 2022 this wasn't over, I'd rather just end it all than keep suffering through it.

The moment I stepped into my tiny studio I started crying hysterically, and I haven't stopped crying every few hours since. Yesterday I found out my sister , who I spent a lot of time with, tested positive. And then I started getting sick. I'm pretty sure I have COVID and the testing tommorow will likely confirm that. And I'm so scared , not as much about being sick but the isolation. It feels like somebody ripped out a chunk of my heart and Im overwhelmed by everything. Schools starting again and I have assignments to do, I'm so hungry, and I need my meds renewed, but all I can think of is how scared I am of being alone. I think I got traumatized by past instances of being alone during lockdown and I emotionally can't do it this time around. There's also a curfew which makes things even worse. I can't even distract myself with TV or movies, I feel no desire to do anything. On top of that many of my friends are suicidal and I'm so so scared that I'll lose someone. I live in Quebec and everything is so fucked, I feel completely trapped and the walls are closing in on me. This cycle of being able to live on my own= there being another lockdown = having a mental breakdown and moving in with my parents = moving back out to the city I normally live in , makes me feel like nothing will ever improve. I have a pet who needs me to care for him but I can't, I'm struggling and I need help. Please if anyone is going through the same thing or knows some tips to cope please help, I feel like I can't breathe and idk how much longer I can do this,",

In our home state, all bars and concerts are vax-only, but that isn't the case in the area he will be visiting. This may be negotiable with sufficient advance notice and a sufficiently small time box - like I can't ask him to quit all concerts until then, but I can ask him to skip for a week while he isn't visiting friends * We live in a city with free PCR and RT-qPCR testing. Right now RT-qPCR appointments are available 7-30 days in advance. Full PCR is far less convenient but we can still get advance appointments. * I'm willing to drop money on at-home tests if they are likely to help * Our area should be past our Omicron peak by then, but not by much",

The few that were walk-ins had wait times of like 4-6hours. But of course it's been recently switched to only be available to those working in places like healthcare, longterm care, etc. So I'm totally out of luck. Up until yesterday I had a headache, painfully dry nose/sinuses, a sore throat, and fatigue. No coughing, my temperature was 37C (on average I'm around 36.5), I'm eating fine. As of today I'm a lot better and really only dealing with some congestion. I'm just so frustrated that I have no way to find out if it's actually Covid. But also, the officials keep changing the guidelines so I have no idea what the rules are anymore. Luckily I'm Work from Home, and although I'm back visiting my dad (been back almost a month), his place is big enough I can still sufficiently quarantine, which I've been doing since Thursday. I just hate not knowing for sure. Even when looking online, due to the new Omicron, the possible symptoms are all over the place.",

I've had three vaccinations (all <ORG> for the first two and booster) and before the whole Omicron thing I was starting to finally relax and was enjoying university and all the freedom was going to clubs etc and felt protected and safe in my university environment and around my friends. Since I left uni for Christmas so many of my friends have tested positive (there was an outbreak amongst my friend group just before I left and I was in close contact with 8 of them however I didn't catch it myself) and more and more people I know are catching it everyday. I'm in a sports society and they're already talking about going to clubs when the term starts so I feel like when I go back I'm going to almost 100% catch it either from my sports team, from my friends or just in general from being in a packed uni environment. Everyone I know at uni is double vaccinated but only a few have had the booster. I just want to enjoy university life but this threat of catching covid is just looming over my head like some kind of inevitable fate. I don't know what to do because the only other option is to drop out of uni and become a house mouse which would make my mental health suffer as I'm extremely extroverted. I'm not so afraid of catching covid and having a mild illness I'm TERRIFIED of this then turning into long covid and being basically permanently disabled for the rest of my life (the brain fog symptoms scare me the most). Any support or advice would be much appreciated because I am really suffering mentally and feel like I'm about to go into the lion's den.",

The only reason I know it's going around is because two of the people who previously had it told me. There is one case in particular that likely exposed people the week before Christmas and our boss never thought to inform us so we can get tested before seeing loved ones during the holidays. And now there have been two more cases since that. I understand not being able to say who has it, but I think it is negligent to not alert us of the threat in general. I honestly feel betrayed, disrespected, and scared. I plan to talk to my boss about my feelings on this - I'd like to ask for better COVID policies, but she doesn't take the pandemic seriously, so I'm worried it won't go well. Any advice on what I can say or perhaps legal/OSHA verbiage I can refer to to assist my case?",

I am not an anti vaxxer, I do believe in science and my kids have all their vaccins up to date. I have concerns that I would like to share so people can help me take a decision. Our government made a vaccin passport and we cannot go to restaurants or do interior activities without it. I consider myself a very responsible citizen and I would like your opinions in a polite manner. I am here to have clearer thoughts. My main concerns are: 1. I dont feel the obligation since we dont have any known health issues and we do not live or work with old people. 2. We all got what we think is covid before tests were available (jan-feb 2020) I had all the symptoms including loss of smell and taste and it was the worst flu of my life. I never got that sick in my entire 35 years. Husband and kids less than me. All my surroundings were very sick. My nurse friend said at the clinic they has lots of unknown cases, doctor couldnt figure out what it was.. and antibiotics didnt work. So many people got it. 3. I wear my mask and keep social distancing and whatever my Quebec (canada) government is asking. Even though I do not follow their logic because of their lack of transparency and open debate. 4. Lots of scientiste, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, are against what is happening and the obligation to get vaccinated. So I do have a trust issue I never get my news from facebook or social media. I do know how to read scholarly articles. 5. Lets not lie about the fact that pharmaceutical companies are getting richer 6. Vaccins have to fo through many years of testings (5-7) so I am scared about long term effect 7. In Israel they started the 4th shot so vaccin is not fixing the problem?! 8.

I know the pandemic will end eventually, but with more variants most likely coming soon, Im not sure if itll ever end.

For my second I was really sick for 3 days with what I describe as a combination of the flu and an awful hangover (103.5 fever, chills, aches, headache, nausea etc). Because of this I have been hesitant getting the booster shot. I got an antibody test couple weeks ago, right before the holidays. To my shock my antibodies are still &gt; 2500. To my knowledge I have never contracted covid. I was exposed on Christmas, I tested negative, but my wife tested positive. Had another test 5-6 days after second exposure and tested negative again. I felt fine throughout the week I was exposed from my wife and before that as well. Considering all of this, I'm thinking of waiting until they come out with a new booster that includes new variants. I don't want to go through getting that sick again without an added benefit. Any thoughts?",

The shop was nice enough to drive the vehicle back to the house (10-15 minute drive plus they had to drive to diagnose) but now Im having a bit of a panic about driving it. They werent masked and its been so long since Ive shared a vehicle with anyone outside of my house it feels uncomfortable. If its been 24+ hours, is there any reason I cant get in the car, maskless, and drive around? I wash my hands enough that I can handle doing that.

There's talk abt reduced symptom *severity*, and some vague studies on antibody levels, but rn the messaging is very much \"you'll still catch it, you'll still get sick, but at least it won't be *as* bad.\" and sometimes even the I know that a lot of this is too new to have super solid information on but it seems almost eerie that I'm not finding *anything*. A lot of \"well, we *think* it *should* work,\" which...doesn't feel encouraging. I'll be honest, I'm just as if not more worried about *any* symptomatic infection, mild or not than I am about the risk of getting severe symptoms (basically, even just getting sick *at all* poses a list of logistical nightmares in my current situation). Add that to having terrible side effects after my second dose, a very strong phobia of nausea (which I got) and a moderate phobia of fevers/chills (which I *definitely* got, oh, god) and the worry about having to either take extra time off work from it depending on how long symptoms last...I'm genuinely considering cancelling my appt tomorrow. Most likely scenario I see rn is I get boosted, deal with *that* again, and then still end up catching covid, having to quarrantine, etc and my only consolation is that I don't get *as* sick. I know the official line is \"always get boosted!!!\" but I need some help convincing myself because the thought of going through what I went through on the second shot again is more than I can handle rn.",

I was concerned about infection from my trip, even with me taking the best of precautions. You guys, as always, were more than supportive! Well, I'm sad to report, that my friend did end up testing positive. We are ending our trip early to head home. We were sharing a hotel room and will be sharing a car (we have no choice) and taking measures to keep me safe. At this time I have tested negative, however I know that can change because only 4 days has passed. I'm not sure how I feel at this point. Weirdly calm but I have my moments where I feel a full blown panic set in. I'm going to isolate immediately when I get home and get tested 4 days after my arrival. I guess I am scared, I don't want my parents to catch it from me. Nor do I want to catch it myself. But do feel immense guilt going on this trip in the first place.",

My workplace has undergone a huge transformation, which means that the default model is working from home. You can work in the office for mental health reasons (such as if you live alone). I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room. In 2019, I met a guy, sparks flew between us, and we were going to meet up. He lives in a different country. It has just fizzled out. My self esteem has plummeted as my weight has rocketed. Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office. Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit. Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement. And I'm symptomatic, which has led to me losing my voice so I can't even speak to anyone on the phone. Which is not good as I've been on and off crying since I got back. And my throat is so sore, hurts to cough, hurts to swallow. I'm just at the point where I'm really not coping. TL;DR My life was looking good, then the pandemic transformed my workplace to mostly WFH, home is 1 bed flat, I live alone. Mental health plummeted, now I have covid.",

I don't really like the Canadian governments' handling, and look at Taiwan as the best model for covid (also with a smarter culture) and just wish we could do what Taiwan is doing - they're all walking around freely! In Canada we've been in yo-yo lockdowns for so long, and hospitals are filling up disproportionately with the unvaccinated^(). And I just think to myself, if all you MF would just get vaccinated, perhaps - maybe - we could avoid a lockdown or at least have a shorter one. I used to rant about the government's handling in some skeptical subreddits, but it's full of stupid people claiming that vaccines are deadly and that lockdowns are some global conspiracy to strip us of our rights. *Trust me, our politicians do not care about us enough to hatch a plan like that. There's no money in locking us all down!* It just frustrates me that there seems to be only two extreme sides: Those who think everyone is out to get them, and those who are to get everyone. Come on people, follow the science. Get vaccinated! Demand better testing, tracing and tacking! Call for local lockdowns to happen sooner to stop covid spread in its infancy. Insist on quarantines for travellers and the positive to be mandatory (and cheap/free). At this rate I'm gonna learn Mandarin and move to Taiwan &lt;\\_&lt; ^() [^([url]",

I had a \"normal\" university from September 2017 to (ugh) March 2020 and ever since then everything has been online for me. That said, seeing a lot of articles online talking about how \"school is changing for better and for worse\" got me fearing for the worst because I feel like even after things inevitably get better with this pandemic that things will never be what they used to. I always felt like graduate school would be my last real chance to find meaningful lasting connections (all other avenues I've tried have either failed or brought me minimal results and PhD was always going to be a lonesome experience) but after hearing all this banter around me of how things are going to stay the way they are (online delivery of courses and many people even favouring this) and not give us a choice of how we would like our schooling experience to be has made me very tense and edgy. I feel like my efforts to find those lasting connections and a partner will all be for nothing...",

We live in a very small apartment and staying away from each other is pretty hard. I do my best to keep distance from them but unfortunately they're the type of people to not care too much about COVID19, they are unvaccinated as well and cough/touch everything like they want to get me sick, it sucks. I on the other hand take this seriously, has been double vaccinated with <ORG>, and wears a mask everyday within the house to avoid getting infected. For the past 3 days I've been having a sore throat, runny nose, coughs, and a few headaches here and there. I've also have been feeling very tired. Luckily my symptoms seems to get better rather than worse over time? It's weird. I'm assuming I got infected but my rapid test came in as negative. I'm waiting for my PCR results but it'll take a few days for it to come in, I took the tests on 1/4/22. I have a flight to Canada (from the US) on the 18th, I really hope things go as planned. I had my flight canceled multiple times and it would be really upsetting if this were to get canceled as well. I've also been reading a lot of posts about peoples rapid test coming out negative but the PCR coming out positive? Is the chances of me falling within this category high? Lets say I do get marked as positive, will I have enough time to recover and become negative before the 18th? Any advice on healing quickly? I've been drinking a lot of water, took Tylenol, vitamins, 9MG Melatonin and sleeping early for the past few days now. How long did you remain positive for? If I were to be marked as negative what advice would you give for me to not get infected till the 18th? Will be a very stressful 12 days haha. 20 Y/O Male btw",

I developed a sore throat and nothing else on the 25th or possibly the 27th (symptom was very mild, so I'm not sure exactly when), which was gone by January 2nd (to be replaced by sniffles and a mild cough). No fever, loss of smell, chills, fatigue, or anything like that. I was double-vaccinated at the time, am now boosted because appointments were hard to snag. Testing appointments are also hard to get, even for rapid tests, and I got one yesterday (January 5th) at a pharmacy. The pharmacist only swabbed my nose. The test came back negative, but I still have the cough (though again, no other symptoms). I can't get another test until Monday at the earliest, because there are no available appointments. I work primarily from home (second, public-facing job was shut down under the new restrictions) and don't have any family in the city (so didn't attend any holiday parties - it was just me and my partner, who also works from home and didn't attend any parties), but I still have to get groceries. Delivery is expensive enough that if I can avoid it, I would prefer to. Can I trust this test? (If you're getting confused with the math (I was), symptoms developed either on the 25th (12 days before the test) or on the 27th (10 days). I've heard way too many stories of false negatives.",

I am just depressed because I ruined the last summer before the pandemic struck. My summer was ruined at first trying in vain to study for the supplementary examination, and then in a depressed rut after seeing that I failed the supplementary examination. If I had just pushed myself a bit harder in vector calculus, I could've had one last carefree summer before all the shenanigans of 2020 happened. It is something I regret. If I can change one thing about pre-COVID 2019, I would have made myself try harder in vector calculus.",

Even though we had a super good vaccine rate. Now we have a variant thats almost impossible to slow down. A lot of social gatherings are getting canceled again. And we had a million cases in 1 day in the USA which I never thought would even be possible. I also spoke to my therapist about it, and she told me that people in the trans community are very covid cautious. And that the reason why a lot of people in that community didn't try returning to normal over the summer was because of a lack of social support from their families. She basically told me that for now I should try a different zoom group to find new friends. And I've tried zoom groups and had pretty bad luck with them in general, and one of the zoom groups I went to criticized me when I said I was thinking of going to Florida for spring break last year, and even after I got vaccinated. And then there's the issue of mask mandates, I have a very hard time seeing how my area will get cases low enough to remove the mask mandate now since they're goal for removing the mandate is currently focused on cases and not hospitalizations. I have a very hard time seeing how omnicron will change their metrics to having lower hospitalizations.",

We were in shared custody before, and last summer his mother basically lost her ever living #$% and is just barely getting into relative stability now. We went through the courts and my brilliant, affectionate, funny, wonderful 13 year old son now lives with me, with only a few days every few weeks at his mom's, which he's actually not quite happy about. As part of the agreement, he spent a few days with her over New Years. He left the 30th and was supposed to come back the 4th. During the night 31st--&gt;1st, he calls me at 2am, panicking: his mom tested positive with a home test for COVID, and he tested negative. The earliest I could pick him back up was the 2nd, and he isolated as much as possible between then and when I could pick him up. Upon returning to my place we were meticulously cautious. He's confined in his room, even for his meals, - he doesn't step outside except to use the washroom which I clean after every use. I try to keep it light, stay - both masked - more than 2m from each other to discuss his homework and read stuff to each other. The days are passing and he remains 100% symptoms free. I'm assuming he was exposed right when he went over there, on the 30th, which would make it day \"1\", and would make today day \"9\", although I'm assuming that the most cautious scenario would be to consider the last contact with her (Jan 2nd) as day \"1\", which would only make today day \"6\". Here's the thing though: it's start to weigh on both him and me, and the idea that we couldn't even have the week-end to do anything together is making him be quite down. Whether we consider today day 6 or day 9, he's still rigorously symptoms-free. Can you help me think through the risks here? I don't want to end his quarantine before it's logical to do so, but I can see the effect it's having... Looking fw to your thoughts",

To some, it means covid-19 is eradicated from the face of the earth, which doesn't actually have to happen for life to return to normal. From what people are saying on this sub, they feel run down by the concept of \"pandemic\" as much as any actual restrictions. In October of 2020, I cancelled my travel home to see my family for the holidays. For months, I'd had in person indoor contact with exactly three other humans. Now, * I get to see many all-vax friends regularly * I feel safe at all-vax restaurants, movie theaters, and large parties * I've got that dope booster immunity * My family and the CDC all approved me going home twice, once for Thanksgiving and once for Christmas. * Case counts may be high, but hospitals are not at capacity due to vaccines, improved treatments, and the actual virus getting milder I'm looking forward to not feeling stressed in non-vax-controlled environments when someone coughs or doesn't mask properly. This is more about me than the pandemic, so I don't know when it will change. I recognize that many of the freedoms available in my highly vaccinated area are less available elsewhere. There's a ways to go, but I think it's really important to keep the pandemic in terms of concrete things that matter. A lot has changed in these two years.

I have yet to catch COVID (to my knowledge.) Recently, with the Omicron surge, a few of my coworkers have tested positive. Its a small retail store with two departments and we are required to wear mask. We share common areas such as a break room and bathrooms. Over the past month theres been a few times Ive wondered if I was positive but always come back negative on a rapid + 1 PCR. Yesterday I experienced a bad headache that went away with Advil and a slight runny nose. This morning I woke up with a bad headache that eventually mostly went awaybut terrible diarrhea. Its still the afternoon and Ive gone 7-8 times. My stomach feels fine, no fever, and negative on a rapid. Its just such a struggle to know if Im actually positive or if my mind is just making me feel this way. The strange thing is, and please dont judge me for this, Im not afraid of getting COVID. Ive accepted that I will probably have it at some point and can only hope for the best and take precautions. Hoping someone has some words of advice.",

When I got the news I just couldn't take it anymore. It seems like this isn't going to end soon, and I just had a wave of emotions that I didn't know how to manage: I was scared for my brother, I was angry, I was ashamed that this happened AGAIN in my home. I wanted to scream and cry and to be done with everything, all at the same time. I had to tell my workplace and my boyfriend that somebody got sick again, I just kept thinking how we need to adjust all at home to take care of my brother and I felt extremely guilty for going out to work or seeing my boyfriend when my brother still didn't show signs of COVID. I just went up to my room and cried a little bit trying to control my anxiety, and then I just went on with all the things we needed to do to take care of my brother. I had anxiety long before COVID, so sometimes there are days I really struggle with. There are some days when I just don't think I'm able to continue anymore and I just wish that everything was over, but there doesn't seem like there is an end to this cycle.",

My covid anxiety was finally gone in 2021 (I'm in Canada, we got our numbers so low) and now it's back full force to the point that I have a panic attack every day. My parents are anti-vax and are friends with even more severe militant anti-vaxers who are also conspiracy theorists. I am an adult who lives alone apart from them. My mom has had two vaccines and my dad is unvaccinated. I've had nightmares and anxiety attacks about my dad dying from covid since the beginning of the pandemic. He refuses to get vaccinated no matter what I say, how I beg or how I plead. On new years, my parents partied with their antivax friends. Last night I had yet another nightmare in light of omicron. Today my dad tested positive. I have not been able to calm down. I've been crying, panicking, the whole nine yards. Nothing I Google regarding an unvaccinated person's chances against the virus is comforting. I'm terrified my dad is going to die. I'm not ready to lose my dad. I just lost my uncle to cancer a month ago. My dad is 60 years old and he's very healthy and fit for his age, but I'm still worried because of his age. Currently he has no symptoms and my mom keeps telling me I'm being alarmist and ridiculous for freaking out so much but I keep panicking about my dad suddenly dying in his sleep or it suddenly turning worse really fast. Additionally, my parents were likely exposed on Dec 30-31 and on Jan 2 my mom insisted on dropping off a bag of food at my place. She's fully vaxxed and I had her stand outside (open doorway) to hand me off the bag, she wore a mask and I wore two masks (I'm triple vaxxed) and yet I'm still absolutely petrified ill develop symptoms at any moment. Literally any words of comfort or something could help rn, all my friends say is \"I'm sorry\" like my dad is already dead and I freak out even more.",

I have to even go to greater lengths to stay in touch with people, and I'm left in a state of depression. I feel like I'm at my lowest point since 2020. I've been eating a lot. Inconsistent schedules. Losing friends. Friends using cancel culture and saying I haven't known you. Even I've been trying to get in contact with a girl who went to school with me, graduated in 2020 during Covid. For two years I've wanted to see her. We eventually texted a bit, but then her lack of communication and respect of autism caused issues. She visited the school again, and I was going to see her, but again lack of communication. We talked later that night and she said \"I said hi to the teachers, I roamed\" and I got very frustrated. And since then, I wanted to meet that girl. I just wrote letters and shit, and it's not doing a thing. It's making me think that I should've met her in the past, where she would've been more nice rather than have her watch me kill myself in a global pandemic. I just wish we talked properly. That's all. She thinks there's no COVID in her eyes. Oh speaking of that, a dysfunctional family and other environments. On some days everything would be good, some days would be shit. I've psychologically had enough of this. World leaders will pay. WHO will pay.",

Nothing severe so far, just congestion and a cough, for the most part. I have asked them about other symptoms and other than some difficulty smelling due to the fact that their nose is stuffed up, there's nothing else to report. They're recently boosted. I'm almost five months out from my second dose, so it's nearly my turn to get boosted too. I have congestion here and there, but mostly I'm just aching and exhausted, and I kept getting headaches on and off, though they seem to have stopped for now. I work from home, but it's been almost impossible to get anything done in the past few days because I'm just so tired all the time. I know we can write this off as something non-COVID, but I'm trying to be realistic here and someone at my family member's job is out with a confirmed case. They were definitely exposed, at the very least. Getting tested is next to impossible, though I'm looking. When I heard the news about how contagious omicron is, I kind of just... accepted the reality that getting it was a definite possibility, even as a vaccinated person. But now that it's looking really likely, especially when I'm reading that experts are saying to assume COVID before you assume the flu or a cold... I'm pretty scared. I tried to get boosted, but until a few days ago, it was too early. I'm trying to stay away from places like the subreddit where people discuss their confirmed cases exclusively. It's a great resource but at this point it's just going to scare the shit out of me, as it's more likely to attract people with more notable (aka, more symptomatic) cases.",

My position was that the long term implications and side effects of Covid seemed more serious and significant. I took 5yo to get their first dose yesterday and while Im hopeful this is the right thing, it is still making me anxious that I fought for this and something will go wrong. Get to do this all over again with our 2 year old whenever that vaccine is approved.

I got in contact with a positive pal, and now need to quarantine (again!), right before finals (and I still have no idea how my college is gonna handle them!). I have some troubling health issues (on top of the smaller but covid-like I had before) that I really need to get checked for, but between the Omicron surge (that has brought the local system almost to collapse), a hacker attack against the health infrastructure, trouble with college and *this* I can't get a professional (or even a doctor) in a timely manner. A relative is ill, but because of the mess testing and diagnosis have been getting increasingly delayed, and I fear that, when it'll be possible again, it's gonna be to late. Also, testing (at least the good kind) is basically unavailable here. Because of many things (again, mostly covid) I also lack a social net, so no partner and only very superficial friendships and all far away. Cherry on the top, studying has been very hard lately, and I may not be able to pass my exams. And I'm not listing everything, only what I'm comfortable with Reddit knowing. So yeah. Fuck.

So, if you've read my previous posts, you'll know my situation of living with antivax parents and how that has affected me mentally speaking. Well, to cut a long story short, I did what you recommended me: I got my shot in secret. Yesterday I got my first dose of Sputnik, and in February I'll try to get the second one. No side effects, apart from pain in the place of the injection. It's been more than 24 hours, so I guess I'm good on that side. It honestly feels surreal. I didn't even plan for it to happen that way, it was a spur of the moment decision. But now something troubles me. I fear my family may get to know it, and I don't feel the same having to hide it from them. I fear I was being impulsive and the best choice was to wait. I try to tell myself I had little choice, with Delta increasing the cases in my town, but it doesn't feel that way. There's also the fears theorists have put on my head, like infertility or altered DNA. Did I do it right? Or I should've just wait? I know it sounds silly, but I'm really second guessing myself. I was actually going to poost here for advice before going to the hospital, but as I said, it was pretty much a spontaneus decision. Thank you for reading, and to anyone who comments.

There are so many questions I realized I couldn't answer with certainty when discussing Covid with them. I was hoping to get some help for answers here. 1. If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? For example, if I am vaccinated and my cousin is not, we both meet my uncle who has Covid and are exposed. Since I am vaccinated, is there a higher chance that my body rejects the virus and so I don't become a carrier and spread it to others? If so, how much higher are the odds (if all other things are equal)? 2. If you had Covid previously, do you have a lesser chance of spreading it? Do Covid survivors have some immunity, so when they are exposed to someone with Covid, they have a much lesser chance to becoming a carrier. Since I had Covid AND I am vaccinated, am I much less likely to be a carrier now? Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but these questions are about the general odds. It seems like the narrative is constantly changing so it gets confusing. For example, now the news seems to be saying that even if your vaccinated you're going to get Covid, but you'll have milder symptoms. Or that you can spread it almost as easily as someone who is not vaccinated, etc. It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this. All news that I've been hearing are very vague with this type of stuff and I don't know why.",

I live in LA County and we hit 43,000 cases in a day the other day so I've been extra cautious. Yesterday my mom (~60, not boosted but vaccinated) went to eat at a restaurant inside a crowded mall for approx 2/3 hours with her friends. I won't control what she does, but I'm not sure how to proceed risk-wise. I'm not afraid of having any serious illness given my age and my mom is at least vaccinated so I feel fine about that, but the one thing I refuse to roll the dice on is having my smell/taste impacted. I have several friends who have diminished or altered smell/taste after having COVID and I would be absolutely devastated if that happened to me. I'd feel bad if I had to distance from my mom just because she went out. Normally I'd think the risk is probably pretty low, but with numbers this high I'm not sure what to think. Any advice? Or anything to assuage my fears about smell/taste? I'm not sure if vaccinations possibly help in that regard.",

I was hoping the end of the pandemic last year of 2021, but it was a disappointment. I mean, not as bad as 2020, but 2021 is a disappointing failure. Now Im worried that the pandemic wont end this year, because of the Omicron. Even the U.S. peaked and continues to decline cases, what if theres another variant comes and rise the cases again. I just want this pandemic to end so badly. 2 or 3 years is long enough. I still hope the pandemic will end this year, I just hope we wont encounter another surprise variant.",

On the 2nd-4th days I was getting really sharp pains in my chest, mostly heart region. This occurred when I was taking deep breaths, which felt necessary at the time. At this point they have mostly stopped but my chest is still feeling tight and the sharp pains happen occasionally. I have also had a lump in my throat that remains persistent. I have no other symptoms, only these two. The chest pains have lessened, but the throat tightness/lump has remained consistent. Im quite worried as I had asthma as a child &amp; I also have IBS. Thank you in advance! Id love to hear other peoples perspectives - - Sorry if this sounds a bit off, I have Autism so explanations can be difficult.

I am 27 and a university student and school starts back up in-person in a couple weeks. My school has announced there will be no delay to the start of in-person classes and I have a job on campus as well that starts at that time. I'll be honest, I'm terrified of catching and dying of COVID. I don't see how there will be a full return to in-person classes without a huge surge on campus, and I don't know how I am going to avoid getting it, from classes or my job. My vaccination status reassures me somewhat, but I also have a few health problems that have clearly shown to carry a high risk when it comes to COVID. Firstly my BMI is very high at 49. I have lost over 60 pounds in the last few months and am going strong with weight loss and healthier eating/daily exercise. But my weight being so high is still clearly putting me at higher risk. Additionally I have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease that is an additional risk factor, especially combined with obesity. I have been attempting to get healthier to address both of these concerns but I am scared that this will not be enough and catching COVID could kill me. I have had an overwhelming feeling of impending doom. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this anxiety/ have any perspective on this situation? I am trying to find a way to only take online classes but I don't know how I'll get by without my job. Any reassurance or insight would be appreciated.",

We did a couple of crowded indoor public things around xmas and tested negative. And we are back to commuting to/from school tomorrow.

        "Reddit Post": "Hopefully this is the right sub for this. Just looking for some advice after receiving a positive Covid test. So, a little background. I started feeling sick this last Tuesday (1/4) at work. Have a chronic cough that got worse and started having bad headaches, muscle aches, congestion, etc. Went home early and got tested Wednesday (1/5). Test came back positive. Doctor told me to come home and self-isolate for at least 10 days since I started feeling sick, so that would be 1/14, since that's when I knew for sure I was feeling sick. I got a doctor's note for work to explain this. Got a call Friday from my boss saying that, due to the new CDC guidelines, the state institution I work for is only requiring five days of quarantine, no need to retest, and that I should be cleared for work this coming Monday (1/10), provided I have improving symptoms. As of right now, other than the occasional cough and some congestion, I'm feeling a lot better, and even those are WAY better than where I was at on Tuesday. Obviously, I want to get back to work, but I'm concerned about how short the quarantine my work is requiring is, when even the doctor was saying I should quarantine for at least 10 days. I, luckily, didn't infect anyone at work, and I'm concerned that I might do so if I return early. Because of the nature of the job, there's a high likelihood that, if I'm still contagious, they'll also get it. Any advice? Should I talk to my boss on Monday, explain the situation, and try to use vacation to cover it? Or should I follow the CDC and my work's guidelines? Really not sure how to proceed here.",

Vaccines werent available in the Philippines for a very long time, and when they finally arrived it was an absolute shit show (endless hours spent on the hotline trying to get an appointment and so on). When I got an appointment after a few months, I couldnt really choose what vaccine I wanted to get, and was presented with Sinovac only. I was hesitant at first, because I heard it might be discredited in the US among other countries, but when I checked the requirements for EU, it stated that Sinovac was authorized by WHO and so I just went with it. I also couldnt really afford to be choosy since I had waited for so long and just wanted to be vaccinated already. Fast forward a few weeks later after receiving my second shot, Sinovac is not authorized for people that want to enter the EU anymore, meaning even if I do get a <ORG> / <ORG> booster shot now, it still wont count. Another option for entering would be to show a proof of recovery, which I dont have and dont know if Ill be able to produce since I havent contracted Covid yet (at least to my knowledge, never had any symptoms). What should I do next? Thank you all in advance for your help!",

Indoor dining is closed due to restrictions, so we will just order room service.

We also wear 3 masks at once (I know Im a bit insane lol), including a KN95, a good quality cloth mask, and a surgical mask on top.

One of them had symptoms since Wednesday and showed up anyway. It's just a matter of time before someone else is positive. There are also many cases amongst 2nd and 3rd year students, last week a few students who were close contacts showed up to class anyway (without getting tested). Today all 3rd year students were sent home, they are considered a cluster. I wasn't there thankfully but that's what my classmates told me. I don't want to go there catch covid and take the subway / bus and the end of the day and spread it even more. They refuse to let us work from home, even though we only need our laptops to work. Subways are packed like crazy of course. It's driving me crazy, it feels like they are just waiting for the whole school to turn into a cluster to close it. I feel bad for not wanting to go, I don't want to get in trouble, but at the same time I also think the school should take proper action before it's too late maybe not close the whole place but my class is pretty high risk right now so we shouldn't have to go anymore at this point.

I had a slight tickle in my throat for 4 days that didn't get worse, so I had assumed that that was going to be it for me, pretty much asymptomatic almost. However, I woke up today feeling a little worse - cough has gotten worse and I have slight congestion today - feels like the very beginning or the very end of a cold. I'm wondering for other people who are tripled or double vaxxed who ended up getting COVID-19, what was your course of illness like? Just curious how it's been for others, and wondering if I will continue to get worse. It's interesting to me that I \"plateaued\" for 4 days before progressing again. Luckily, I still feel pretty good and I have my vaccines to thank for that! I don't know if I have Omicron or not but it's likely that I do as it has pretty much displaced delta where I live.",

        "Reddit Post": "&amp;#x200B; \"Life will never go back to the way it was before Covid19\" has been the rallying cry of the depressing since the pandemic began. It's followed with more doom and gloom theories like the idea that \"masks don't work\" and \"vaccines don't work\", etc. There has been this idea that some Covid was a magical, mysterious new force that could evade all attempts to stop it. But it's not. It's dangerous, sure, but it is just a virus. It isn't \"trying to find a way around our immunity\" or \"going after certain populations\". It isn't waiting for prayers to stop it. It's stupid. It's not even a life-form. It's a piece of biological machinery dependent entirely on the living to do anything at all. It's a gear...not the engine. Masks slow it down, quarantine slow it down more, vaccines much more than that and so on. But to really go back to pre-covid19 days we would need not only vaccines, herd immunity and basic safety measures, but also a way to \"Tamiflu\" the virus if caught in the early days. All these steps together should bring us back to levels and severity more consistent with a typical flu season. And if instead of regular covid shots along with our flu shots we could get a LIFETIME immunity, well that would just be a ridiculously good outcome. Omicron is typically a milder version on an individual basis than other variants and while it is spreading too quickly to be safe to society at large, it will create a lot of herd immunity. With these two final pieces of news, hope is definitely on the horizon. &amp;#x200B; [[url] &amp;#x200B; [[url]",

Because honestly, there is no guarantee that we wont be getting another deadly variant that may be even as transmissible as the current one. And this pandemic has thrown so many curveballs that it feels like it wont end any time soon. Maybe in 10 years. Every time we are told oh it will end very soon, it doesnt. I think my hope has run dry. Theres nothing concrete to hold onto and hope just feels illogical. If were just going to be in a perpetual pandemic because we refused to give vaccines to the poor countries of the world, Im not sure how much longer I can live with this. Ill stay alive for now, but once it reaches fall 2024, when Ill have completed an associates degree and will be moving on to university, I have a vague plan to possibly end my life if its still like this at that point. How do you even have hope anymore? Sure pandemics end but im not strong enough to be in this for years and years, just blindly wondering if it will actually get any better.",

I don't use the microwave and when I take food out of the fridge, I leave it for 30 minutes so at room temperature before eating it. The microwave kills all the nutrients in food. I rarely eat any type of junk food hence why I never get sick! I make sure I get enough sleep every night and well as work out every day and meditate. I have never met one person that lives a healthy life like myself hence why I never get sick. Before 10 years it was a different story cause I had such a poor lifestyle. I've lost my job cause I didn't get the Covid vaccine. Can't do lots of things now cause I've lost my rights BUT if you have Covid, you are excepted for 6 months. You can do what the vaccinated can do (everything) where I can go back to work if I get Covid and travel. 2 of my housemates have Covid where I want to get Covid from them. It's been 2 days where they have been vaccinated but my girlfriend and I have no symptoms still. I shook their hands, let them cough where they shake my hand and I rub it in my face. It's been 2 days and I don't have any symptoms. I want to make sure I get Covid tomorrow where I'm going to get tested in 2 days. How can I make sure I get Covid tomorrow? I want my old life back and the same rights as being vaccinated. If catching Covid is the only way, so be it! I have to put food on the table at the end of the day.",

Body odor and flatulence smells pretty bad. The best I can describe it is like a rotting smell... I've never had issues with this in the past lol. Also, for some reason sub sandwiches smell similar but not as bad. Not sure which ingredient is causing it, maybe vinegar or mayo. Everything else smells pretty much the same as before covid.

He was losing his damn mind lol Nothing crazy but actually starting to see family again. Not back to normal but not a prison either. We got engaged last Sept. We want to have a small engagement party. 25 people. One day of normalcy to celebrate. We set it up for the end of January. Now the surge. So we decided to ask for a negative covid test in order to come. We let everyone know to please either have an appt or an at home test by the RSVP date. Don't want to pay for a set number of people only to have no one be able to get a test and be out the money. We were also able to buy a couple of extra at home tests if anyone needs. My fiance texted his friends in a group chat informing them of all of this. One of my fiance's friends and his gf had covid over the holidays. They're saying they're still going to test positive by the party. My fiance informed them that if they do, unfortunately they won't be able to attend. They have been going out to bars and outings since they've recovered and we can't run the risk of that test being the \"old\" covid or a new infection. This has caused a huge debate in the chat with another friend threatening not to come if original friend is not allowed. My fiance simply replied \"okay, you will be missed.\" We just one normal damn day to celebrate and we're trying to make it as safe as possible for everyone. It's just ridiculous to have so much push back over a darn covid test. We're just trying to the best we can during such a hard time...",

A few people in the group are unvaccinated, and for this reason we felt that it would be fair for everyone test before getting together. Decision was made in December, a reminder was sent out yesterday to make sure everyone was on the same page. For a few reasons we are trying to be extra cautious.. 1. 3 kids under 3 will be attending 2. 1 5 month pregnant guest 3. 2 guests actively trying to get pregnant One couple pushed back pretty hard following the reminder. They voiced up it being unfair to expect them test and that it is their right to not share medical information (only thing we asked about was result of COVID test, nothing to do with vaccination). Also, since they live in a more rural town they cited not being able to get tested due to the time it take and availability(I looked into the Walgreens in their town, tons of availability to get a free, drive-up test within a couple miles from their home. This is not something I brought up to them). They also suggested the my wife and myself choose not to attend the event since I am the one who initially shared the request to test (I typically coordinate events). Not everyone in the group is concerned about COVID, but up until now everyone was willing to accommodate the most cautious if it means being able to get together. Between the young kids, pregnant woman, couples trying to get pregnant and some friends who are anxious/nervous about COVID it just made sense to me to ask this of this group. Other than the one couple who voiced against getting tested, nobody has complained even though I am sure a few other people aren't thrilled. I'd love some feedback on the situation.",

I soon followed suit, and contracted it myself a couple days after as well. We've both been out of work for 9 days now, both of us still testing positive. My place of work has been hit hard with COVID since I left, so they recommended a place to get a rapid test and hinted that I would be reimbursed for the test if I saved my receipt. Up to this point, my Regional Manager has been very helpful and kind about this situation. This test was $125, which was the most expensive one so far. I knew my work had told me to keep the receipt, so I assumed it would be matched by my work. I tested positive still, so I sent her a picture of the paperwork and she says, \"Cool, we'll reimburse you.\" Seconds later, she texts, \"oops, you actually don't get reimbursed. You got it from your girlfriend and not someone at work. So since you were the first person to bring it in, everyone else gets a free testing since YOU gave it to them.\" How could they blame me, with no concrete proof? How could they think to give everyone else a reimbursement but me? It's almost as if they're punishing me for thinking I was the cause of this! There's no way to prove I brought this infection, in a retail job where we handle up to 100 customers a day? And even if that was the case, they are supposed to cover the costs of COVID testing for ALL employees regardless, right? I'm feeling very frustrated and angry, and I just need answers. Is there someone I can call to sort this out? Or should I just accept my losses?",

I live with a family member that I would prefer not to expose to the virus. I've been quarantined for the last week and I've tested at home, and was negative 5 days (around what was the mean day of symptom onset) after exposure. I've had COVID before, and I got sick around 5 days after COVID exposure the last time. I'm triple vaccinated now, too. I still feel like I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop. Every twinge in my back, sneeze, and throat tickle puts me on edge (I'm in New England so the air is insanely dry right now, both outside due to the bitter cold and inside due to heating). I know I'm not out of the possible incubation period, but I just feel like I can't be so lucky as to have direct exposure and not get sick this time. Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the vaccine, but it feels like with so many breakthrough cases that I should just expect to get reinfected. I've read booster efficacy sits around 75%. I feel like that should be more reassuring than what my current state of mind has me feeling. I used to feel a sense of comfort, having been vaccinated and having \"hybrid\" immunity, etc, but this surge of Omicron has really crushed that feeling. I know it's milder, which I'm happy about. It's just that this moment we're living through is incredibly unnerving. I'm essentially just venting and trying not to catastrophize. Thanks for reading.",

Like, really adventurous, even as a kid. I relished the opportunity to venture outside my comfort zone and try new foods, including new applications of the few ingredients I didnt like. I even loved pungent foods - washed rind cheese, jars of anchovies, fermented soybeans, you name it. Fast forward almost two years since the pandemic and I hardly recognise this version of myself anymore. I tend to gravitate towards the same four vegetables over and over again, unless other vegetables have been pureed or cooked beyond recognition. Most textures repulse me to the extent where I will cycle through the same meals which usually tend to be on the blander side. I grew up in a multicultural household so for me to be eating food so lacking in flavour (curries are now well and truly out of the question) oddly feels like Im losing part of myself, which is consistent with how many of us are feeling at the moment. Ive been through a lot of major changes over the past 24 months, pandemic notwithstanding, and as someone with depression and anxiety, this may well relate to that. That said, I was wondering if anyone else has observed significant changes to their eating habits, and whether this has coincided with any major changes in circumstances and wellbeing.

I was told (before losing healthcare) delaying may result in needing a liver transplant, but don't know how likely this actually is. I was able to start treatment a couple months ago (a year later than planned) and now they want me to come in and do tests to see how it's working, like ideally in the next week. However, I live outside the service zone of my parents' insurance, and I would be traveling to the Bay from LA when currently omicron is spiking here. Both my partner and I work in schools where a shitton of students and faculty have tested positive or been exposed, specificallytoday. My father has stage 3, almost stage 4 cancer and has been doing weekly radiation and my mother works in-person, so I don't want to expose the household further. Paying to stay anywhere else isn't financially feasible (actually, even traveling up there by bus or plane will almost put me in debt right now) and I don't have anyone to ask in the area to stay with, and also don't want to expose anyone else in case I catch COVID in LA or during travel. (I could literally travel up there, do my appointment, and come back down, but it would be very hard on my body, and I would feel terrible without visiting when I feel like I have limited time left with my dad..) I will be aging out of my parents' insurance this year anyway and plan to be either under student healthcare or my partner's plan (insurance marriage, lol) by the end of the year. I'm thinking of holding off on taking care of my medical needs until the end of the year when I can hopefully switch to LA-based services. I was wondering if this sounds... logical given the situation right now, or if I am being too paranoid. I understand my condition would potentially suffer if I'm forgoing tests that would detect something abnormal right now, but I'm just too scared (and broke, tbh) to travel up there and potentially expose my parents.

I cant get free healthcare where I could talk to a doctor about my medical condition until I get my social security number, which isnt coming for another 8-12 weeks because theyre notoriously slow. Until I get that and my booster shot, Im worried that I could get COVID, so I dont want to join clubs or societies yet. I havent had a meaningful interaction with someone face to face in over 4 weeks. Even the short conversations Ive had at the grocery stores have been limited since the country Im in (Sweden) are known for not making small talk. This is all fine for me in non-COVID times, when Ill meet people, but right now Im struggling. I feel so alone. I love the country, but the lack of interaction with people is getting to me. I work so I have some conversation there, but its online so I cant even strike up a conversation at my desk or in the kitchen. Before now, I was living with my family, so I could talk to them when I needed to. I can still call them or even video call them, but its not the same. I even feel distant from my friends back home because most of them havent been great at keeping in touch during the pandemic and now its even worse. I just wanted to let it out. Thanks for reading.",

For instance just before COVID there was a trip I was invited on which I had declined thinking \"there will be another time\", and now it's been years since (among many other things I've foolishly put off). It's made me feel guilty for delaying a lot of things but most importantly makes me feel bad for working a job where I'm not appreciated and strongly dislike. I know the generic cliche advice is to look forward but I can't help but think about how I've spent a lot of time being treated poorly instead of doing what I enjoy, it's gotten worse recently and I'm extremely stressed out all the time from work. I had COVID about a month ago and they simply demanded I come back to work right away without any regard for how I am feeling, it's not a good feeling to know if you died they'd simply go \"ah shit need to post another job ad\". I guess my main grief isn't the conventional \"I am scared of permanent side effects of long covid/my relatives/family dying or suffering\" but rather that over the last little while it's really clicked just how fast time has gone by and how I've made very poor use of it. It's been keeping me up at night and really thinking about it most of the day. I try to do the right things that feel \"productive\" but it's always somewhere between the back and front of my mind and it goes from anger to sadness to anxiety to feeling of powerlessness.",

I have to. I've been having a two hour long panic attack over this and I cant, cant get covid. If I do I have to die. I dont even know why im posting. Looking for reassurance probably. Dont tell me 'oh it'll be mild' because that doesn't matter. I either don't get it and live, or I do get it and I off myself",

Had that cough for the rest of the month, very minor, until my sicknss peaked between 12/28-12/30 with a 10 hour fever, headache, fatigue, cough, sinus pressure, and sore throat. Got antibiotics and started to feel better. Did an at-home covid test and that came out negative. I still scheduled a PCR for 01/08. Well, that PCR came back positive yesterday, 01/11. I took 3 at-home covid tests (1 test I even swabbed my throat in addition to nostrils) last night. All negative. This whole time, I've been home majority of the time except for being on public transportation on 01/07. I'm boosted and was double masking but if I caught it, that's where I did. My wife has been testing negative during the same timeframe with both PCR and at-home tests. Basically I just want to ask, with omicron, can one test positive in less of 24 hours of possible exposure?",

Caffeine has similar effects. Where I used to wake up and drink a monster with 10mg of Adderall, now I can drink half and monster or take 5mg of Adderall, but not not both. Has anyone else has similar side effects post Covid. The real bummer is that I'm still feeling super fatigued, but can't use my normal tools to fight it.",

        "Reddit Post": "Hello! I come seeking the advice I hoped I'd never need. I work at a school alongside a teacher who just got back positive results for a PCR test she took Monday. We're in a room that's probably about 80sqft, so a small and windowless space. We're both always masked(me with a kn95, her a surgical mask) and vaxxed(I'm also boosted). The reason it's possible is that she had a cold over the winter break that she could never get tested for, but might have been covid and that showed on the PCR. Her rapid test for re-entering school on Monday was negative. She's supposed to take another rapid test on Saturday, so we'll see how that goes. I'm not especially worried for myself. I'm triple vaxxed, 31, and healthy. My dilemma comes from living with my 70 year old mother and 66 year old, diabetic father. They're also triple vaxxed, and my dad's diabetes is actually pretty controlled, but obviously I want to protect them. Aside from masking around the house, and staying confined to my room as much as possible, is there anything I can do? In addition, because I'm triple vaxxed, currently negative, and asymptomatic, I'm still going into work, where I'm masked and staying inside our office, unless asked to cover a class because they're very short-staffed, unfortunately. Anything I can do to keep the kids safe? Any extra precautions I should take? I know the CDC doesn't recommend quarantine, just masking, is that.... fine? I'm not about to go to the movies, but maybe a drive-thru Starbucks or seeing my boyfriend fully masked for a minute this weekend.",

It was torture finally having some time off the same time as my wife and not being able to spend any of it in the same room. Today, my beloved wife (who took very good care of me while I was laid out) told me that a co worker tested positive today, and she was exposed to her (close quarter work for 2 hours) 2 days ago. We are not sure what the rules of engagement are if my wife does test positive. Would I be in the clear to still be in the same room as her? Since I just had Covid, would I be likely to be fine/immune even if I remained in close quarters with her? Prior to being infected, I was double vaxxed/boosted.

They had me take a rapid test because I told them someone in my house was sick with a respiratory illness last week and I had been fatigued, achy and congested on and off up until early this week. So I got a negative. That wasn't very surprising seeing as I'm no longer fatigued or aching. I am congested on and off but nothing particularly notable. I do, however, have a double ear infection, something I haven't had since I was a kid. I was told this was likely due to a different illness clogging my eustachian tubes and preventing my sinuses/ears from draining properly, leading to infection. They said COVID couldn't be ruled out as the cause, despite the negative result. So take that as a cautionary tale for post-illness, I guess. If your ears hurt, see a doctor. But my question isn't \"did COVID do this to me\" because there's really no way of knowing if I had it or not at this point. My question is, should I consider myself safe for other people to be around, and should I get my booster when it's due at the end of the month? I don't want to put it off, but I want it to actually be useful.",

Yesterday all department employees went through PCR testing to discard the possibility of any cases after the holidays; a guy who sits in the cubicle next to me tests positive and we are told he has a high viral load, meaning hes extremely contagious. I tested negative, but, the lab said they detected a small viral load on my system and advised my office to sent me home and get tested again on Monday; I dont know what variant I had in November, but Im vaccinated (2 pfizer doses, last one on July 21); I havent been boosted because theres no access to boosters where I live (I actually have scheduled a booster for end of February). For reference, I disinfect my workspace every morning and wear a KN95 mask plus my prescription glasses everyday, plus I wash my hands multiple times a day. Mask only comes off on my lunch Hour, for about 15 minutes while I eat alone at my desk. Considering I tested negative, but the lab noted the presence of a small viral load; does this means Im going to develop COVID again? How worried should I be? So far I dont have any symptoms that would make me think I have this and yesterdays PCR was negative. Could that change?",

It started with my heart pounding in my chest and feeling anxious but has morphed into high blood pressure and the symptoms I mentioned above. I was traveling with my finac and started having severe chest pain and shortness of breathing and headed to the ER. I arrived with a blood pressure of 160/100, but all the labs and tests came back normal. They chalked it up to either long covid or that I had covid again, but wouldn't test me again since I had it so soon. When we got back home I went to my primary care doctor as advised by the ER and they did another EKG that came back like a heart attack, but it was a false positive and scheduled me for an echocardiogram... I feel like the symptoms are serious, but I also feel like it could just be anxiety, but none of my doctors have suggested that or have even mentioned how we can treat it. Has anyone experienced this? It has been frustrating to have no answers or course of action. Symptoms Still: No appieate Heart-Pounding/Palapations Medium-High Blood Pressure Weird Chest Pain Deep cough",

I've heard from a couple of sources, probably doomer sources but anyway, that there is no guarantee that covid-19 will become milder with time and it's unlikely to become endemic in the future, i.e. this year or the next few years, simply due to this fact. Don't want this to be a doomer article but I'm really concerned how we can be \"living with covid\" like we live with all those other viruses if there's no guarantee it will become milder with time and the threat that a new variant will pop out of nowhere and send us back to square one, will always be there?",

If I've got the science correct, the main problem with COVID is the severely enhanced cytokine storm. And some scientists initially have suggested immunomodulators like the one I'm on for very severe cases of cytokine storms, but that data has seemed to not be as correct as thought (talking Infliximab for anyone wondering) Not only that but it also lowers the efficiency of the vaccines, too. + I have a brother who just can not think outside of himself.

How could it not? The one thing that worries me though is we know that the largest business interests can completely control policy due to their influence on politicians. Regardless of where they are in the political spectrum - right, left or center. So it's safe to say that the oil lobby will want to return to normalcy and they wield a lot of power. They want travel to come back, people to get into their cars and go places, and the manufacturing economy to start chugging along at full speed. Then you have the entities that actually benefit hugely in this pandemic phase: companies like amazon that have obliterated retail and keeping people out of malls only helps their business. Pharma companies that are rolling in cash not just for vaccines but for anything people want to take that they think might help them. I'm sure there are many others. When things go back to normal, amazon is going to see their record profits return to normal. So isn't the question - who has more power, the ones benefiting from this new normal, or those that want it to return to previous times?",

Ive had a few close contacts/exposures over last week and this week, the most recent one being Monday. I have a 6 month old baby so just for piece of mind really, I tested every day since. On Thursday morning I tested using an On/Go rapid test and it came back positive but with a really faint line, faint enough that I had to shine my light on it to see it. Trying not to panic, I wanted to be extra sure so I worked (from home) waited 8 hours and then took the other test out of that same box. This time, the positive line showed up a little more visible but at about minute 7 I noticed that the line was half gone. And by minute 10 it had completely disappeared. Confused and anxious, I took a different brand test (Quidel Quick View) and that came back negative after the ten minutes. I was feeling a little manic that day from all of the confusion and ended up digging that test out of the trash after about an hour and it looked like there was a positive line there, but it wasnt there the first time. Friday morning I tested negative and also Saturday I tested negative. Throughout this whole time I never had any symptoms except for a baseline morning headache and a bit of a dry throat that tends to go away by mid morning. I am currently waiting on PCR results to come back but they wont be here til Monday. What are your thoughts? Has anyone experienced this? Thanks in advance!!",

        "Reddit Post": "Omicron May be milder than delta. There is a catch. There are two major problems. These problems were not seen with delta. 1. Vaccine evasion. This may be the sole reason why this variant is the worst one yet. It can infect you no matter what vaccine you got, or how many times youve been vaccinated. An omicron specific vaccine would likely help, but our vaccine makers are too slow right now with this creation, and should have started making it back in November when this was discovered. It evades almost all immunity provided by vaccination. It does not evade T cells, however, and I personally feel we were really lucky we got away scot free with that. Nevertheless even being sick with Covid is not acceptable if youre boosted. 2. Transmissibility: this variant is almost as contagious as measles. You can get it even being masked with a cloth mask next to one other person, outside. To sum it up, this variant nearly brought us back to March 2020. We got really lucky, but we may not be so lucky the next Time. Currently, this is the worst variant of the pandemic. Virulence is moot when the other factors come into play.",

I've heard we can be optimistic about it becoming endemic, and hence living with it exactly like we've lived with the flu, this year. hHowever I've also heard there is no guarantee that will happen this year or even in the next few years. How reasonable is to expect that after this wave the situation will more or less be stabilized and society will settle on a base of restrictions and keep to that rather than yo-yoing in out of lockdowns/closures.

It started out, in the early days of the sub, as a place to post good news stories as a counter to all the media dooming. In retrospect, that may not have been the best idea as it took the good news stories out of being peppered through the sub, where they may have been more uplifting overall. So I don't want to go back to that. Then it sort of morphed into 'why this week's Mink mutation/variant isn't going to evade all vaccines/have a 20x higher fatality rate' whenever a(n inevitably overblown) news story threatened to take over the sub. Which is still going to be needed occasionally but not every week. I'm loathe to just let it fade away, as it's a good place to collate useful resources and links, like the ones below, but it would be nice for it to have more of a 'feel' or a reason to be updated every week. So, over to you. And ideas? 'Useful link of the week'? Online AmongUs sessions? r/COVID19_support movie stream night? Quiz night? Discussion evening - and if so, on COVID topics or something else? Let me know your thoughts. And, in the meantime, here's the old useful resources link that need somewhere to be parked: **HIGHLIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS STICKIES:** **Resources for students:** [[url] **For the latest information on the various new strains and their additional transmission/mortality rates, please stick to reliable news outlets:** [[url] [[url] [[url] **COVID19 Anxiety Workbook and other health anxiety resources** [[url] **Home hygiene during COVID19** [[url]",

After speaking with my manager I was put on Medical Leave of Absence which allowed me to keep and self pay for my healthcare. My wife and I went into hard lockdown. Mostly deliveries of food, although I did do a little shopping at TJ's when they used to have senior hours. Fast forward to June of 2021. The grocery store called and said I either had to return to work or resign. This was a corporate wide policy. I resigned. The COBRA premiums were $790 per month. While I still had some savings, this was really beyond my budget. In September I got a job with a very small company. I work as an electromechanical tech fixing receipt printers. I have never removed my mask while in the building. Lunch? In my car. Sip of tea? Step outside. Snack or fruit? Step outside. On the 7th of this month one of my colleagues was in the same room as I and started to have a coughing fit. He ripped his mask OFF and coughed for 10 or 15 seconds. It must have been in that brief moment that he infected me. When I showed to work the next he was not in. I scheduled a PCR test and thankfully was able to schedule one for that Friday. When I woke that morning I had some unexplainable aches and pains. I was at work, but following my test appointment I went home. That night I had coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and a slight fever. It was either Thursday or Friday that I infected my wife. She has similar symptoms, but she has also lost senses of taste and smell. I cannot say just how angry I am at me colleague. Maybe it was the way I was brought up, but if I have a coughing fit I cover my mouth, not rip a protective barrier off. Anyway, just wanted to rant a little bit, thanks for reading.",

I hope California is peaking and declining. Anyway, I hope it gets better in the spring and hopefully cases will continue to decline, and this time, no more variant surprises.",

I understand these measures are nessasary for keeping people safe and I'm fortunate to have not lost anyone to COVID. I feel selfish for even thinking this way because Ik lots of people have lost people close to them and lost their livelihoods. I just dk how much longer I can take this for. None of my hobbies bring me any joy anymore. The only things I get joy out of now are smoking weed and hanging out with my gf (we've been hanging out outside lately cause cause of how bad the numbers are getting here)(I'm in Canada btw). I hate that I'm young and that older people have been able to experience more of their lives pre-covid. It disturbs me that life might be like this forever. Do you think life is ever going back to normal? Cause I really wonder if it's ever going to.",

If i say anything that goes against what they are doing, it will cause them to become violent. My stepdad does not cover his mouth to cough or sneeze, and he doesnt wash his hands even after using the bathroom. Nothing in the house is disinfected at all, despite them acting like they are fine (my stepdad wakes up at 4am every morning to lift weights, up to 85lb dumbells). My conditions cause severe osteoarthritis, subluxations and nerve damage, so doing intense sanitation constantly is not an option for me. I havent been able to make any food because they are always in or right next to the kitchen (from 4am-11pm). I am not supposed to have food in my room, but i havent eaten in three days. Ive just been crying in my room because getting covid is not an option. i cannot afford more bills, and i am at risk for permanent complications or death if i get infected. I dont currently have anyone else that i can stay with, and i cant just not eat. I dont have any money at the moment, but i have some bread and canned vegetables. I am seriously debating taking what little food i have and staying in my car until they dont have it anymore. any advice would be appreciated, and thank you in advance.",

I miss being able to frequently go to malls, restaurants, and places I've never been to before without the worry of catching the virus. I just find myself constantly reminiscing about good memories, which makes me feel a little bit better. This pandemic has ruined my mental state and led me to burnout. I mean, the constant loneliness and boredom FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR would make anyone insane. At first I loved quarantine because I thought this was just gonna last until 2021 and there was no school. But now with online classes and the pandemic still going on? It just, makes me feel burnt out. There could've been so many opportunities for me if it wasn't for this pandemic. Back before the pandemic, I was this energetic, smart, and promising kid full of potential, but now, I'm this miserable guy who does nothing but browse the internet all day. It's unbelievable how things have gotten this bad in just a span of one or maybe two years. Despite all of that, I still feel optimistic, that one day once all of this is over, I'm gonna be able to go back to the places that I've always wanted to go back to, get more opportunities, and of course, rebuild my life to the life that I had before the pandemic, but this time an improved one, as I've learned a lot about life during the pandemic, so that's a plus I guess. But until then, I guess I'm gonna try my best to fill the dark void of my life. In other words, I'm gonna try to be more productive and get more hobbies, with the good memories I've made in the past motivating me.",

What are the rules in your country and how are you trying to work with or around them? Do you feel more optimistic or not about the coming months ahead? I know some people feel that with being triple vaxxed they feel more laid back and confident to do things and live life despite the situation (following local rules of course) whereas some are much more worried and hesitant of the virus, or somewhere inbetween, all of which are very understandable but I can imagine affect one differently mentally and how they view the situation. Personally I'm living quite normally now, I wear a mask in shops if its required and I cant go out partying as much as I want as the bars are shut but otherwise for me covid is now pretty much a frustrating nuisance than a huge roadblock. I'm triple vaxxed as are most people I know and I'm not particularly fazed anymore about catching it, if it gets me it gets me and I accept that. Perhaps because of this, I do feel very optimstic looking ahead now, things do feel like they are slowly getting better. What about you though?",

My dad died before I was born, so she pretty much raised me on her own, so I understand she didn't want to lose anyone else, but she's gone too far this time. Right now, she lives in our old house, far away from where I'm staying right now, but I used to visit her and stay with her for a few weeks from time to time before the pandemic. She lives in Japan while I'm staying in California. Two weeks ago, I got my second dose of the <ORG> vaccine, I never told her about it since my first dose because I knew she'd freak out. Yes, I waited for a while just so I could get my vaccine without her knowing. I already became positive before, too, luckily I was asymptomatic. My mother also became positive last year and she had rough symptoms, she was hospitalized for a day but she still wouldn't take a vaccine after she recovered. Just recently, my mother called me, screaming and crying her lungs out, asking me why I took a vaccine. She was CONVINCED I was gonna die. I swear I could hear her tossing stuff in her house, the call went on for half an hour. She eventually just hung up. I thought it would end there, but I later had a call from my aunt, saying my mother is talking about selling our house and my stuff to save up for \"funeral services\". Sounds ridiculous, I know. As far as I know, she hasn't done anything yet but knowing how deeply she believes all these stupid crap about the vaccines, she might actually do it. The whole situation is so crazy and laughable that I just don't know how to deal with it. Do I just ignore her and wait for her to calm down? I actually considered visiting her but I believe Japan has travel ban, so that's out of the question. I actually don't know how my mother found out about me getting my second dose, my only guess is she infiltrated my Facebook account somehow.",

The past 4 days have been a vicious cycle of forcing myself to eat maybe 2 meals a day and then by the late afternoon, I start getting nauseous and then anxiety kicks in and I really cant eat then. Exa: I had oatmeal with strawberries this morning then around 2 pm I had a vegan chicken sandwich (which tasted like burning flesh since I have slight Parosmia atm). I always intend on eating dinner but just cant get myself to do it because I am nauseous 24/7 and the thought of eating makes me want to gag. My feet are ice cold 24/7 and my hands are too. I am plenty hydrated and drink liquid IV to make sure I have plenty of electrolytes. I also eat fruit every day. Has anyone else experienced this and does it eventually go away? Im so devastated lately as I seemed to get the WORST post covid symptoms despite me being double vaccinated. I have never dealt with anxiety, loss of appetite, etc in my life. I was so happy and outgoing. I have at least 2 panic attacks a day and tell my parents how I feel. They dont care much and think the smell and taste thing is overreacting and will go away. Maybe it will, but as of now it hasnt, and theres a chance it never will. Im scared because I desperately need to gain weight again but healthy foods dont really have high calorie counts. I cant eat processed stuff rn as it tastes disgusting. For reference, Im 51, so 95 pounds may not seem terrible, but for me that is significant weight loss and it scares me.",

Not sure if it matters but when I was exposed we were outside and sitting across each other at a large table. I have no symptoms. My friend who was also there and who I rode home with, has tested negative. I am quarantining the next 5 days to be safe, and if no symptoms occur I should be OK. But heres my question/issue: Someone was telling me I NEED to get tested. I work from home every day and I know there are folks who need the tests for work, travel, school, etc., so I dont feel like I should get tested. If anything, waiting in line for a test for 3 hours could expose me and cause me to have it. It feels more responsible for me to quarantine, and go back to normal (whatever that means these days) in several days if no symptoms occur at that point. Am I wrong for thinking this way?",

I see posts like these and I get confused (the blue and yellow figures are today's report on deceased vaccinated/boosted; red figures are deceased unvaccinated) [[url] According to the Dept. of Health of Puerto Rico: **91.9%** of the total population has at least a dose of the vaccine, **80.2%** of which are fully-vaccinated. We had been doing great before Omicron (keeping infection rate at 2% I believe... it is now at 30+%). [[url] There is so much information going on that I am having trouble making sense of it. Essentially people are worried that vaccines are causing issues or not working or something else is going on because these posts show more vaccinated people dying than unvaccinated. I would like to figure out how that translates with the high vaccinated population we have. Let me do some math (please correct this if it's wrong; I'm not great at math and am using a formula I found online): If we have 80.2% (**2,509,034** people) fully vaccinated, of which 15 died today, that means: **(15/2,509,034) x 100% =** **0.00000597839** fully-vaccinated people died today out of the total of fully vaccinated crowd. If we have 19.8% (2,509,034 - 3,076,212 of total people = **567,178)** unvaccinated, of which 6 died today, that means: **(6/567,178) x 100% =** **0.00001057868** people unvaccinated died today of the total of the unvaccinated crowd.

We also dont then hide under a rock.. as in we eat at restaurants- ideally outdoors but not entirely.. and we go to grocery stores. For me its viewed as mitigating risk.

        "Reddit Post": "For two years, I've lived in fear of getting the virus. I got vaccinated (May 2021) and boosted in December. As did my housemate. However, she thinks that is some kind of shield that makes her more strong against any virus and now doesn't take any precautions at all. No more masks, works at a convenience store where she could be infected by anyone, and now she has decided to take a couple hour road trip in a closed car with someone who just last week sounded a lot like she had the virus, but wasn't tested, so it's hard to know. I just want to be able to relax and forget about it. I've done everything I can to protect myself, but with her constantly exposing herself to the virus, it's hard. And no, I can't move or throw her out as we both share the rent and neither can afford to pay the rent alone, especially me who has gotten ill with other problems and lost my insurance. I've tried convincing her, but she always says \"You got to die sometime.\" and brushes me off. I'm actually surprised she at least went and got the vaccine and booster at the same time I did at least. From what I hear, boosted people aren't really getting bad symptoms from it, so I'm wondering if I'm just being panicked over what could wind up being no worse than a bad cold (something I may already have had a few weeks ago around Christmas)? I have so many issues in my life these days that I can't afford any more panicking or I'll die from heart problems long before Omicron gets me. Sorry, just had to rant a little...I am glad to see some of the good news reports here in this forum rather than the clickbait you see on the media sites.",

Now, Covid can't be 100% be ruled out by the test. The fever friend also has no known exposure to Covid though has been suffering from pandemic fatigue so hasn't been vigilant post-vaccination. The friend also loves having people over so exposure could be through an asymptomatic person. It could be the flu. Both partner and I are fully vaccinated/boosted for covid and flu. But I have had a really bad experience with the flu years ago while vaccinated that I would never want to relive again. There are specific Covid isolation guidelines, but is it prudent to use them for illness symptoms without verification of whether it is Covid, flu, bad cold, or some other virus? Currently, Thursday plans may be canceled, but it's not clear about the status of the Friday gaming night.",

Got my positive result Jan 13 via NHS. My isolation is over and feel absolutely fine now but still testing positive on RATs/LFTs. In order to enter Canada, one must have either a negative PCR -or- positive PCR from 11+ days ago. Am now flying home on Jan 29 which will be 11+ days from my positive test BUT: -NHS tests are apparently not acceptable for travel (the result email has all information e.g. Name, DOB, Test Date but does not have address of test provider) If do a private PCR next week (this is the acceptable type), there's a chance it's going to be positive and positive for a long time and apparently starts my isolation all over again. Have made a telephone appointment with my doctor in Canada to see if he can get me a letter confirming I'm fit for travel. But have no idea if this will be accepted with the NHS positive result and terrified of being fined at the border. With the airline I'm flying with, flights to Canada are only happening once a week. Feel angry, frustrated and upset. Why is this so hard?! Since the beginning, I have tried so hard to do everything right, stay safe and keep others safe. Now just want to go home. According to the science, I'm past the transmission stage so why can't just go home? Has anyone had a similar experience? What did you have to do? At this point, I think my best bet is to do a private PCR for the positive result and move my flight again. Not ideal, especially when I've just started a new job! I'm fortunate enough to work from home and can work whilst I'm here, but it's not the same when you don't have all your equipment and setup. My brain is not firing on all cylinders at the moment.

        "Reddit Post": "I have posted on here previously about my fathers antics and how scared he is of covid. Since omicron has took over hes not letting anyone go out unless its for a doctor appointment or the store for groceries. Its like 2020 all over, he kept us in for the entire year until the vaccine was available. His excuse for keeping us in the house is bc of my asthma which is pretty severe. Im in California and omicron is pretty bad rn but he makes it seem like if we get the virus well just instantly die. Its like why get vaccinated and boosted if I cant do anything with my gf or family. I understand covid is bad and how it affects everyone differently but i hate how he is the most healthiest one in the family rarely gets sick but is the most scared. He doesnt wanna see family or his friends. Before omicron whenever we go out and stuff hell make us feel guilty. My 15 yr old niece cant even go to school or hang with friends because of him and thats really keeping her back socially. The last time I went out with my gf was Dec 17th and idk how long I can stay in this house.",

I woke up at 4 am and threw up for about 5 minutes straight, even since then I have felt kind of tired with a constant stomach ache.

I'm still really scared though. My grandma told me she read that it will be fine but i dont trust their reading. Is it safe for me to shower there? Also, an update on my own health, since last time I posted a lot of people nagged me to get tested and isolate. I had a couple days of scratchy throat and drainage, but I bought a humidifier for my room and that helped IMMENSELY. like, within an hour my throat was perfectly fine and my drainage had improved a lot. It took a couple days for my system to get back to normal, but I'm fine now. I figure it wasnt covid because covid wouldn't have gotten better so quickly.",

        "Reddit Post": "My 30 year old wife is double vaccinated since about 5 months ago, and has recently had Covid with semi mild symptoms (worse than a common cold, but nowhere near going-to-hospital sickness). Her symptoms ended about 3 days ago. And today she got an SMS telling her that she now can book an appointment for her booster shot. Is it medically more advantageous to get the booster shot as soon as possible, even this short time after she had Covid? Or is it better to wait a while (like a few weeks or months), since her body has boosted it's own immune system when fighting the infection? I also got Covid (PCR verified), shortly after my wife. And in my case I had actually taken the booster shot shortly before getting sick, as in 3 days before. Does the closeness of my booster shot and my infection change anything for me? Will my protection be just as strong, and last just as long, compared to if I hadn't had Corona? Or might it improve my protection, or worsen it? The Corona information websites in our home country (Sweden) doesn't really say much about these things, and when googling there seems to be mixed information.",

I go to school and, over the period of a day, I was seated about 1m away from a person who later got covid symptoms (their family was positive) for about an hour in total. Both times were in big, ventilated rooms and we were both masked. I normally would be freaking out about an exposure but this person is veeeery quiet (never said anything to me, never spoke in the entire time we were seated next to each other). I was wondering what the risk is, if we were both masked and there was no coughing/talking/sneezing. Thank you!",

She does not get help for these issues and makes no effort to work through her behaviors, blaming shitty insurance coverage. She doesn't even see a regular doctor despite the fact that she has multiple chronic disorders that badly need to be treated-- again, this is due to her health anxiety. She also will not get vaccinated. She wants everyone in the house to be vaccinated (which, we are) but says that her anxiety makes her exempt from it. I at first tried being empathetic, had some talks with her about it, and hoped she'd come to a point where she fears COVID more than the vaccine. However, the opposite is true. She scares herself incessantly with medical articles about side effects from the vaccine and worries she'll die if she gets it. She ended up getting COVID after my dad and I got it. The entire time, I was worried she was going to die or be hospitalized due to the state of her health. Thankfully, she's ok, but her anxiety has now consumed her-- it's been weeks since and she will barely leave her room, disinfects everything, etc. She keeps me back from things in life because she wants me to protect her since she's unvaccinated. She won't allow me to see friends or get a new job. I don't see family or anything of the sort either. I'm very miserable and depressed, I love her but the untreated anxiety feels like a burden. I feel fatigued and I can't offer much empathy anymore. At some point her mental health is her responsibility. What can I do to help this situation... if anything? I'm so scared for her health.....",

I keep reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is sort of a pointless risk- why risk the side-effects of the booster when it won't even help me? But I also think, are the other/older variants (delta, original Covid) still in circulation? Maybe I should get vaccinated to protect against them? I don't know. I have already taken the first 2 doses of the <ORG> vaccine, and I took my second dose back in July 2021. I had little to no side effects. I was well enough to keep working. But I've always dreaded getting the vaccines because of the possible side-effects. I am a late thirties male in normal health and normal weight. I feel like if I have to risk side effects like myocarditis, it has to be worth it. I work from home and only leave to go shopping, so I feel like my chances of catching covid are relatively low. So my questions are As a late 30s male: * Do I risk side effects of the booster that has low efficiency against omicron? * Or should I wait for the vaccine that is customized to it? * Or should I take the booster because the older more dangerous variants are still circulating? Any advice is appreciated",

Well time went on and the internet became a bigger and bigger part of my life, today my prevalent forms of socialization are discord servers and vtubers, at this point I feel like I am not able to connect in real life even if I wanted to (and the fact that I literally cant dosent help that much). and its bound to get even worse since I am going to graduate this year, I will be in a profession where I will work alone.

It sounds solid right? i wont be putting anyone at risk, right? i know it might sound stupid but i just feel so anxious and my brain wont just relax. I feel so scared i will bring back anything to my elderly grandparents, it makes me feel selfish.",

She drank plenty of water this time around, and my brother mentioned that when she got up to make her coffee in the morning she sat back down and felt woozy and passed out. Shes fine and feeling better thank god, and an ambulance was called that ran vitals that were in fact normal. Im just happy shes fine, and now shes fully vaccinated.

I tested at home again and it was bright pink positive so I went from quarantining in my house to a specific room. 9/7 rolls around and I submit my covid tests to my work. They say this does not count, I have to go to an approved facility. So I find one and go get tested late 9/7. Today 9/8 I receive my results as a negative PCR test. So on record I never had it. My question is did I have it, do I have it, and should I still quarantine. Does one negitive PCR out weight symptoms and two positive Antigens? Or does the 4 days apart between the two tests negate everything? I was positive but since I have the vaccine I quickly got rid of it. My 11yr old daughter who is very sick tested positive on the antigen also and negitive the same day on the PCR. To add to this I do have <ORG> vaccine back in April/May time frame.

In my case, I got my second <ORG> dose in April, I'm 46, and my main potential complication for severe illness is a case of mild hypertension (so mild currently that I'm not even medicated and just control it through lifestyle adjustments, but it is documented in my medical records and I have been hospitalized for it before). But I do teach college in-person full-time, but then I don't know if that qualifies me as a \"teacher,\" since often they only apply that to mean K-12. I'm also teaching on a campus with both mask and vaccine mandates, and we have something like 90% of our population vaccinated. There has been no guidance from my university or from my original vaccine site, except that they do not currently have boosters in stock yet. Is it six months or eight months? Am I a \"teacher\"? Do I have a \"risk factor\"? The language is so, so vague. :/",

Epidemiologists have oddly learned that testing viral loads of municipal sewage is a remarkably accurate predictor of what will happen with cases, about a week in advance. This is proposed to be because this provides a comprehensive sample that includes asymptomatic cases, those that avoid healthcare or rely on non reported home tests, and may reflect viral loads. This correlation has proven accurate in many many municipalities across the last two years and therefore is increasingly more trusted. Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen. In the US they seem to have peaked and are falling. In this one article the slope seems to be falling really fast. [url] [url] More info about how and why this is done: [url]",
